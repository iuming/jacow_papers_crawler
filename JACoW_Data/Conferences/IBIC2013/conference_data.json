Precise measurements of the electron bunch charge distribution (BCD) and its arrival timing are crucial keys to maximize and keep 3D overlapping between the high-order harmonics (HH) laser pulse and electron bunch. We constructed a relative timing drift monitor based on EOS",
            "which measured the timing differences between the seeding HH-laser pulse and the electron bunch",
            "using a common external laser source of both HH-driving and EO-probing pulses. The feedback system of timing drift was realized with real-time data processing of EO-signal spectra. Our system realized stable seeded FEL operation with a hit rate of 30%. The 3D-BCD monitor enables non-destructive measurements of the longitudinal and transverse BCD at the same time. The transverse detection can be used to control the relative pointing between HH-pulse and electron bunch. We also verified this transverse detection with multiple EO crystals at the EUV-FEL accelerator. Our next target for temporal resolution is 30 fs",

Without attenuation the best recorded C-band cavity resolution was 27 nm. A laser-wire transverse electron beam size measurement system has been constructed and operated at the ATF2 beam line at KEK. A special set of electron beam optics was developed to generate an approximately 1μm vertical focus at the laser-wire location.

          "abstract": "ELBE is a LINAC electron accelerator for small energies (12 to 50 MeV). It serves as a beam source for many quite different experiments. The recent ELBE upgrade allows electron beams with bunches in the range of single electrons to 1 nC. The maximum beam current is 1.6 mA CW and the repetition rates covering the range from one shot single bunch pulses to 26 MHz CW. The existing BPMs and especially the DCMs which are used for the Machine Protection System cannot handle this wide parameter range. To improve this situation the development of new BPMs / DCMs was necessary. The DCMs measure the difference of the beam current between two stripline sensors and produce an interlock for differences greater 10 microamps. The new BPM electronics system has been designed including the DCM functionality because both BPMs and DCMs use the same stripline sensor signals at 1.3 GHz.",

The requirement for the observation of both low intensity pilot bunches and high intensity bunches for physics requires a detector front-end with a high bandwidth and a large dynamic range while the usage for Schottky measurements requires low noise electronics.

Measurement of the absolute spectral intensity of coherent radiation emitted by an electron bunch allows monitoring and reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile. To measure coherent radiation in the teraherz and infrared range a in-vacuum coherent radiation intensity spectrometer was developed for the free-electron laser in Hamburg(FLASH). The spectrometer is equipped with five consecutive dispersion gratings and 120 parallel readout channels: it can be operated either in short (5-44 um) or in long wavelength mode (45-430 um). Fast parallel readout permits the monitoring of coherent radiation from single electron bunches. Large wavelength coverage and superb absolute calibration of the device allows reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile using Kramers-Kronig based phase retrieval technique. The device is used as a bunch length monitor and tuning tool during routine operation at FLASH. Comparative measurements with radio-frequency transverse deflecting structure show excellent agreement of both methods.",

In order to characterize the longitudinal phase space of the beam in the SNS 1GeV proton LINAC the bunch profile needs to be measured with a few picosecond resolution. The original SNS set of diagnostics included only four interceptive Feschenko-style longitudinal profile monitors in the normal conducting part of the LINAC at 100MeV. Two recently added systems are: a non-interceptive laser scanner in the injector at 2.5MeV and a novel non-interceptive method for longitudinal Twiss parameters measurement using the beam position monitors in the Super Conducting LINAC (SCL) at 300MeV.

            "Diamond detectors are used as beam loss and luminosity monitors for CMS and LHC. A time resolution in the nanosecond range allows to detect beam losses and luminosities of single bunches. The radiation hardness and negligible temperature dependence allow the usage of diamond sensors in high radiation fields without cooling. Two different diamond detector types are installed at LHC and CMS. One is based on pCVD diamonds and installed at different locations in the LHC tunnel for beam loss monitoring. Measurements of these detectors are used to perform a bunch-by-bunch beam loss analysis. They allow to disentangle the origin of beam losses. The second type uses sCVD diamonds and is located inside CMS for van-der-Meer scan",

Results on the performance of these detectors will be presented and examples of the use for analyzing the beam conditions will be given.

            "e.g. higher luminosity",

The ongoing experimental work is trying to benchmark the theoretical models focusing on the physics of vacuum breakdown which is responsible for the discharges. The CLIC collaboration has commissioned a dedicated 12 GHz test-stand to validate the feasibility of accelerating structures and observe the characteristics of the RF discharges and their eroding effects on the structure. A versatile system for detection of the dark and breakdown currents and light emission is being developed for the test-stand. It consists of a collimation system with an external magnetic spectrometer for measurement of the spatial and energy distributions of the electrons emitted from the acceleration structure during a single RF pulse. These measurements can be correlated with e.g. the location of the breakdown inside the structure using information from the incident",

The project imposes certain technical challenges on various accelerator systems including beam diagnostics. In the first place these are a high beam power and strongly varying operating modes ranging from microsecond beam pulses to the cw regime. Diagnostics development interleaves with the construction of the diagnostics instrumentation required for the test facility which delivered the first beam in Fall of 2011. The paper reports the present status of various diagnostics systems along with measurement results obtained at the test facility.",

The principle is appropriate to determine the transversal beam density distribution as well as the transversal and longitudinal beam emittance behind the RFQ. The instrument will be located at the end of the MEBT with the detachment taking place inside a dipole field. Extensive particle tracking simulations have been performed for various settings of the MEBT quadrupoles to investigate the best placement and size of the 2D scintillating detector and to determine the range and resolution of the instrument.

The grid is used to analyse the 10 keV H− beam coming from the ion source and the obtained beam parameters will be used as input for simulations of the beam transport in the accelerator. All 42 wires can be read out simultaneously with a multi-channel precision electrometer and the data can be fitted instantly with LabVIEW code that was developed for this purpose.

In SwissFEL the longitudinal compression of the electron beam is performed by means of two magnetic chicanes and an off-crest acceleration scheme. The curvature induced on the beam longitudinal phase-space during the compression can be compensated by means of an X-band cavity. The beam longitudinal phase-space can be experimentally characterized by means of a Transverse Deflecting Cavity (TDC) and a profile monitor in a dispersive section. Longitudinal phase-space measurements at the SwissFEL Injector Test Facility under compression with and without X-band linearizer are presented. In addition",

Larger magnification and operation at shorter wavelength provide improved spatial resolution. Reflective optics enables convenient switching between different wavelengths. An optical table is located in a hutch outside the storage ring tunnel to provide access during operation. Movable obstacles in the beam path create interference patterns and thus provide redundancy of model based analysis of the images.

The next generation of camera sensor Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) promises to provide the technology to improve optical interferometry. A series of measurements was performed on the Australian Synchrotron storage ring using a sCMOS and a intensity imbalance optical interferometer. The coupling in the storage ring was varied from maximum to minimum using the skew quadrupoles and the beam size at the optical diagnostic beamline was varied from over 100 microns to around 1 micron. A comparison is made between interferometer measurements using the sCMOS with and without an intensity imbalance and with previous measurements using a CCD system."

The baseline system for providing the required beam parameters and signals is based upon two ultra-low-noise AC beam transformers and associated digital signal processing. The AC beam transformers cover different frequency regions and are an adaptation to the ELENA layout of those used in the AD. Two AC beam transformers will also be installed in the extraction lines to provide beam intensity and bunch shape measurements. The digital signal processing will be carried out with the leading-edge hardware family used for ELENA’s low-level RF system. The paper provides an overview of the beam transformer and head amplifier",
            "as well as of the associated digital signal processing."

An alternative is to mix the drive and received signals to form a phase detector. Using this technique, the phase shift across the resonant section of beam-pipe can be observed directly on an oscilloscope. The growth and decay of the EC density has a time constant of roughly 100 ns, while the measured phase shift will include a convolution of the EC density with the impulse response of the resonant beam-pipe - typically about 500 ns. So any estimate of the growth/decay of the cloud requires deconvolution of the measured signal with the response time of the resonance. We have also used this technique to look for evidence of EC density with a lifetime that is long compare to the revolution period of the stored beam. These measurements were made at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) which has been reconfigured as a test accelerator (CesrTA) with positron or electron beam energies ranging from 2 GeV to 5 GeV.",

Until 2012, thanks to the excellent performances of the injection system of the storage ring, the perturbation on the position of the stored beam was small enough to be accepted by the users. For some specific experiments, few beamlines expressed their wish to be able to stop their data acquisition during the injection. To fulfill this need, the diagnostics group of Synchrotron SOLEIL has designed the “TimEX3” board which was integrated into the timing system allowing the gating of the Top-up injection. This design was released as open hardware. Towards this aim, we decided to design it with the open source and free EDA software “KiCad”, and to make it available under the CERN’s Open Hardware Repository."

This monitor measures the beam profile in the low and medium energy beam transfer line where the beam dimensions can be as large as 100 mm. Reasonable position resolution is achieved with a harp consisting of 64 wires per plane and a pitch of up to 1.7 mm. Special effort was needed to produce such harps and bring the signal cables out of the vacuum. As the readout electronics has to cope with DC as well as pulsed beam all 128 wires are acquired simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating the charge during the “flat-top” of the beam pulse and storing it for serial transmission to the back end electronics for conversion. The high accuracy requires calibration of offset and amplification errors for every single channel. A NI PXI FPGA card controls the readout chain. The code for controlling the readout",

            "The Free-Electron Laser Laboratory at the University of Hawaii has constructed and tested a scanning wire beam position monitor to aid the alignment and optimization of a high spectral brightness inverse-Compton scattering X-ray source. X-rays are produced by colliding the 40 MeV electron beam from a pulsed S-band LINAC with infrared laser pulses from a mode-locked free-electron laser driven by the same electron beam. The electron and laser beams are focused to 60 micron diameters at the interaction point to achieve high scattering efficiency. This wire-scanner allows for high resolution measurements of the size and position of both the laser and electron beams at the interaction point to verify spatial coincidence. Time resolved measurements of secondary emission current allow us to monitor the transverse spatial evolution of the e-beam throughout the duration of a 4 microsecond macropulse while the laser is simultaneously profiled by pyrometer measurement of the occulted infrared beam. Using this apparatus we have demonstrated that the electron and laser beams can be co-aligned with a precision better than 10 microns as required to maximize X-ray yield."

Measurements of UV coherent transition and diffraction radiation have been used to quantify the bunching produced by the seed laser at lower laser harmonics. The dependence of the laser induced CUVTR signal on various parameters is experimentally studied.

            "This contribution presents the development of the data acquisition (DAQ) system for the readout of fast beam current transformers (FCT) as installed in the GSI synchrotron SIS18 and as foreseen in several FAIR ring accelerators. Fast current transformers are reliable devices that offer a large analogue bandwidth and can therefore monitor bunch structures with high resolution. At appropriate sampling rates continuous measurements throughout repeated machine cycles lead to a large amount of raw data. The analysis of those raw data may range from simple bunch parameter calculations to complex longitudinal phase space reconstructions. Consequently",
            "a new DAQ system must be carefully designed to allow for flexible acquisition modes or to allow for data reduction methods in special applications. The aims of the development are discussed and the status of the new DAQ is presented."

This new current monitor will abort the beam when the difference between two toroidal pickups exceeds a threshold. The MEBT DBCM will protect the MEBT chopper target while the SCL DBCM will abort beam to minimize fast beam losses in the SCL cavities. The new DBCM will also record instances of errant beam such as beam drop-outs to assist in further optimization of the SNS Accelerator. A software Errant Beam Monitor was implemented on the regular BCM hardware to study errant beam pulses.

The recent ELBE upgrade allows electron beams with bunches in the range of single electrons to 1 nC. The maximum beam current is 1.6 mA CW and the repetition rates covering the range from one shot single bunch pulses to 26 MHz CW. The existing BPMs and especially the DCMs which are used for the Machine Protection System cannot handle this wide parameter range. To improve this situation the development of new BPMs / DCMs was necessary. The DCMs measure the difference of the beam current between two stripline sensors and produce an interlock for differences greater 10 microamps. The new BPM electronics system has been designed including the DCM functionality because both BPMs and DCMs use the same stripline sensor signals at 1.3 GHz.",

The requirement for the observation of both low intensity pilot bunches and high intensity bunches for physics requires a detector front-end with a high bandwidth and a large dynamic range while the usage for Schottky measurements requires low noise electronics. This paper will present the design of this detector system as well as initial results obtained during the 2012-2013 LHC run."

Measurement of the absolute spectral intensity of coherent radiation emitted by an electron bunch allows monitoring and reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile. To measure coherent radiation in the teraherz and infrared range a in-vacuum coherent radiation intensity spectrometer was developed for the free-electron laser in Hamburg(FLASH). The spectrometer is equipped with five consecutive dispersion gratings and 120 parallel readout channels: it can be operated either in short (5-44 um) or in long wavelength mode (45-430 um). Fast parallel readout permits the monitoring of coherent radiation from single electron bunches. Large wavelength coverage and superb absolute calibration of the device allows reconstruction of the longitudinal bunch profile using Kramers-Kronig based phase retrieval technique. The device is used as a bunch length monitor and tuning tool during routine operation at FLASH. Comparative measurements with radio-frequency transverse deflecting structure show excellent agreement of both methods.",

The original SNS set of diagnostics included only four interceptive Feschenko-style longitudinal profile monitors in the normal conducting part of the LINAC at 100MeV. Two recently added systems are: a non-interceptive laser scanner in the injector at 2.5MeV and a novel non-interceptive method for longitudinal Twiss parameters measurement using the beam position monitors in the Super Conducting LINAC (SCL) at 300MeV.

Two different diamond detector types are installed at LHC and CMS. One is based on pCVD diamonds and installed at different locations in the LHC tunnel for beam loss monitoring.

        "The phenomenon that currently prevents achieving high accelerating gradients in high energy accelerators such as the CLIC linear collider is electrical breakdown at very high electrical field. The ongoing experimental work is trying to benchmark the theoretical models focusing on the physics of vacuum breakdown which is responsible for the discharges. The CLIC collaboration has commissioned a dedicated 12 GHz test-stand to validate the feasibility of accelerating structures and observe the characteristics of the RF discharges and their eroding effects on the structure. A versatile system for detection of the dark and breakdown currents and light emission is being developed for the test-stand. It consists of a collimation system with an external magnetic spectrometer for measurement of the spatial and energy distributions of the electrons emitted from the acceleration structure during a single RF pulse. These measurements can be correlated with e.g. the location of the breakdown inside the structure using information from the incident",

        "which even using state-of-the-art technology are limited in their effective intra-bunch position resolution to few tens of um in the multi-GHz regime. Oscillations at this scale cause partial or total loss of the beam due to the tight transverse constraints imposed by the LHC collimation system. To improve on the present signal processing",
        "a prototype system has been designed",
        "constructed and tested at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron (SPS) and later on LHC. The system splits the signal into multiple equally-spaced narrow frequency bands that are processed and analysed in parallel. Working with narrow-band signals in frequency-domain permits the use of much higher resolution analogue-to-digital-converters that can be used to resolve nm-scale particle motion already during the onset of instabilities."

This optical system has an entrance aperture of 300 mm and it can cover the large opening angle (± 13.5 degree) of the OTR from 3GeV protons. A CID camera with an image intensifier (II) was use to observe the profile.

        "however a long-standing problem with these devices has been the growth of leakage current through the ceramic insulation within the XBPMs over time",
        "often becoming greater than 10% of the signal current after a few years of operation. The growth of these leakage currents has been found to be exacerbated by the application of a negative bias (-70V) to the tungsten blades",
        "a bias suggested for optimum position sensitivity. This bias is applied in order to accelerate free electrons away from the surface of the blades and to prevent cross-talk",
        "however",
        "we have found that the operation of the XBPMs without bias has negligible impact on our measurements. Removal of the bias has been found to prevent the growth of leakage currents over time",
        "and can also significantly reduce the cost of our signal acquisition by removing the need for a low-current amplifier with a bias supply."

As a critical step toward the construction of a single shot bunch profile monitor using Coherent Smith-Purcell radiation it is important to measure very accurately the distribution of such radiation. Optimum background suppression techniques need to be found and relatively cheap detectors suitable for the far infra-red need to be qualified. To perform these tasks a test stand has been installed at the end of the linac of the synchrotron SOLEIL. This test stand and the first results from its commissioning will be presented here.",

        "the AGS emittance has been measured by using an ion collecting IPM during the whole cycle and a multi-wire at injection. The beam profiles from this IPM are distorted by space charge forces at higher energy",
        "which makes the emittance determination very hard. In addition",
        "helical superconducting snake magnets and near integer vertical tune for polarized proton operation distort the lattice in the AGS and introduce large beta beating. For more precise measurements of the emittance",
        "we need TBT measurements near injection and beta function measurements at the location of devices used to measure the emittance. A Polarimeter target has been used as flying wire for proton emittance measurement. A new type electron collecting IPM has been installed and tested in the AGS with proton beam. The Beta functions at the IPM locations have been measured with Orbit Response Matrix (ORM) methods and with a local corrector at IPM. This paper summarizes our current understanding of AGS emittances and plans for further improvements."

The laser wire emittance scanner under construction is based on a photo-detachment process utilizing the neutralized particles produced in the interaction between Laser and H− beam for beam diagnostics purposes. The principle is appropriate to determine the transversal beam density distribution as well as the transversal and longitudinal beam emittance behind the RFQ. The instrument will be located at the end of the MEBT with the detachment taking place inside a dipole field. Extensive particle tracking simulations have been performed for various settings of the MEBT quadrupoles to investigate the best placement and size of the 2D scintillating detector and to determine the range and resolution of the instrument.

Covariance and temporal causality are the two faces of the same coin: failing in implementing one of the two constraints into the model necessarily implies betraying the other one.

Essential longitudinal diagnostics required for commissioning and operation include the intensity measurement for bunched and debunched beams and the measurement of Dp/p for debunched beams to assess the electron cooling performance. The beam phase information is also needed by the low-level RF system. The baseline system for providing the required beam parameters and signals is based upon two ultra-low-noise AC beam transformers and associated digital signal processing. The AC beam transformers cover different frequency regions and are an adaptation to the ELENA layout of those used in the AD. Two AC beam transformers will also be installed in the extraction lines to provide beam intensity and bunch shape measurements. The digital signal processing will be carried out with the leading-edge hardware family used for ELENA’s low-level RF system. The paper provides an overview of the beam transformer and head amplifier",

An alternative is to mix the drive and received signals to form a phase detector. Using this technique, the phase shift across the resonant section of beam-pipe can be observed directly on an oscilloscope. The growth and decay of the EC density has a time constant of roughly 100 ns, while the measured phase shift will include a convolution of the EC density with the impulse response of the resonant beam-pipe - typically about 500 ns. So any estimate of the growth/decay of the cloud requires deconvolution of the measured signal with the response time of the resonance. We have also used this technique to look for evidence of EC density with a lifetime that is long compare to the revolution period of the stored beam. These measurements were made at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) which has been reconfigured as a test accelerator (CesrTA) with positron or electron beam energies ranging from 2 GeV to 5 GeV.",

Recent results show that in a majority of cases the RF signal transmission takes place by coupling to standing waves excited in the vacuum chamber. In such a case the effect of a varying cloud density is a simultaneous amplitude",
        "phase and frequency modulation of a fixed frequency drive signal. The characteristics of the modulation depend not only on the cloud density values and spatial distribution",

In this paper we evaluate the relationship between measured modulation sidebands amplitude and the electron cloud density when cloud and electromagnetic resonance rise and fall times are of the same order of magnitude",

        "A Beam Position Monitor (BPM) system has been designed for the Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) at the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) to acquire beam position information. This article introduces the design and implementation of the BPM electronic system. The challenge of designing the BPM electronics is to acquire and process the signal with large dynamic range (5.8mV~32V) and changing width (80ns to 500ns). The analog circuit described in this paper",
        "which is constructed of a single-stage operational amplifier and an analog switch",
        "can cover the input signal with large dynamic range. Because of the minimum bunch length (80ns) and the requirement of position resolution",
        "a 14 bit 250MHz ADC is adopted to digitize the signal. Besides",
        "for BPM system",

        "which show that the resolution of Bunch-by-Bunch position is 0.8mm when the input signal is 5.8mV and the resolution of Closed Orbit position is 50um."

In order to minimize this disturbance the tilts and the timing of injection kickers need to be tuning carefully based on real beam information. A set of button type pick-up and a scope based IOC were employed to capture the transient beam movement with bunch by bunch rate during injection. Several sets of observation and analyze will be discussed in this paper.",

Until 2012, thanks to the excellent performances of the injection system of the storage ring, the perturbation on the position of the stored beam was small enough to be accepted by the users. For some specific experiments, few beamlines expressed their wish to be able to stop their data acquisition during the injection. To fulfill this need, the diagnostics group of Synchrotron SOLEIL has designed the “TimEX3” board which was integrated into the timing system allowing the gating of the Top-up injection. This design was released as open hardware. Towards this aim, we decided to design it with the open source and free EDA software “KiCad”, and to make it available under the CERN’s Open Hardware Repository."

        "The currently installed Bunch Arrival time Monitors (BAMs) at the Free electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH) achieved a time resolution of less than 10 fs for bunch charges higher than 500 pC. In order to achieve single spike FEL pulses at FLASH",
        "electron bunch charges down to 20 pC are of interest. With these BAMs the required time resolution is not reachable for bunch charges below 500 pC. Therefore new pickups with a bandwidth of up to 40 GHz are designed and manufactured*. The signal evaluation takes place with a time-stabilized reference laser pulse train which is modulated with an Electro-Optical intensity Modulator (EOM). The new BAM system also requires new EOMs for the electro-optical frontend. The available selection of commercial EOM candidates for the new frontend is very limited. In this paper we present a comparison between different EOM candidates for the new electro optical frontend."

        "production and commissioning of MedAustron’s beam profile grid monitor. This monitor measures the beam profile in the low and medium energy beam transfer line where the beam dimensions can be as large as 100 mm. Reasonable position resolution is achieved with a harp consisting of 64 wires per plane and a pitch of up to 1.7 mm. Special effort was needed to produce such harps and bring the signal cables out of the vacuum. As the readout electronics has to cope with DC as well as pulsed beam all 128 wires are acquired simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating the charge during the “flat-top” of the beam pulse and storing it for serial transmission to the back end electronics for conversion. The high accuracy requires calibration of offset and amplification errors for every single channel. A NI PXI FPGA card controls the readout chain. The code for controlling the readout",

        "The Free-Electron Laser Laboratory at the University of Hawaii has constructed and tested a scanning wire beam position monitor to aid the alignment and optimization of a high spectral brightness inverse-Compton scattering X-ray source. X-rays are produced by colliding the 40 MeV electron beam from a pulsed S-band LINAC with infrared laser pulses from a mode-locked free-electron laser driven by the same electron beam. The electron and laser beams are focused to 60 micron diameters at the interaction point to achieve high scattering efficiency. This wire-scanner allows for high resolution measurements of the size and position of both the laser and electron beams at the interaction point to verify spatial coincidence. Time resolved measurements of secondary emission current allow us to monitor the transverse spatial evolution of the e-beam throughout the duration of a 4 microsecond macropulse while the laser is simultaneously profiled by pyrometer measurement of the occulted infrared beam. Using this apparatus we have demonstrated that the electron and laser beams can be co-aligned with a precision better than 10 microns as required to maximize X-ray yield."

        "Recent progress in development of accelerator technology for future linear colliders and X-ray free electron lasers has generated an interest in developing novel diagnostics equipment with resolution surpassing the unique beam parameters. Cherenkov radiation (CR) in the X-ray region in the vicinity of the absorption edges is one of the promising sources for relativistic charged particle beam diagnostics. In this work we have demonstrated CR characteristics in the X-ray region significantly depend on the energy of the emitted photons",
        "because the CR is only generated in the frequency region in the vicinity of the atomic absorption edges",
        "where the well-known Cherenkov condition is work. This peculiarity can be explained by resonance behaviour of the permittivity in the frequency range. It will result in the fact that the CR will stand out of any other types of polarisation radiation both on intensity and shape of angular distribution giving a unique opportunity to apply this phenomenon for charged particle beam diagnostics."

This new current monitor will abort the beam when the difference between two toroidal pickups exceeds a threshold. The MEBT DBCM will protect the MEBT chopper target while the SCL DBCM will abort beam to minimize fast beam losses in the SCL cavities. The new DBCM will also record instances of errant beam such as beam drop-outs to assist in further optimization of the SNS Accelerator. A software Errant Beam Monitor was implemented on the regular BCM hardware to study errant beam pulses. The new system will take over this functionality and will also be able to abort beam on pulse to pulse variations. as it is based on the FlexRIO hardware programmed in LabVIEW FPGA and can abort beam in 5 us.

        "the 6.5GHz cavity BPM system builds as much as possible upon industrial components. The analog front-end solution is somewhat untypical",
        "and generated some interesting discussion. Instead of the usual heterodyne downconverter",
        "a hybrid based RF detector rectifies the signals in front of the μATCA-based digitizer. Phase shifters are used to zero calibrate the channels",
        "as well as a calibration tone feed through the reference channel. The measured resolution is ~1.4μm",
        "however",
        "efforts to improve the resolution <0.5μm are underway. These include adding a downconvertor section into the signal processing. The pros and cons of this improvement were discussed rather controversial."
