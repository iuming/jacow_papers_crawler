The injector section including the first bunch compressor stage was extensively tested in a dedicated facility with excellent beam performance results. The 6 GeV driver linac is based on normal conducting C-band technology. The modular linac building block",
        "including the RF source",
        "has been developed by PSI in collaboration with industry. The linac module design provides optimum overall system economy and very good beam dynamic properties. High power tests of all linac module components as well as system tests have been performed successfully. The start of commissioning for the whole facility is scheduled for 2016."

        "the linac is operated at 10 Hz with a thermionic RF gun and the electron bunches are kicked out from the linac at either 3 GeV or 1.5 GeV to reach the respective storage ring. For the Short Pulse mode the linac will operate at 100 Hz with a high brightness photo cathode gun. Compression is done in two double achromats with positive R56 and the natural second order momentum compaction",

The accelerator has fast removable X-ray converter and can operate both in e-beam and X-ray processing modes. The machine utilizes a low frequency (176 MHz) 6-cells SW accelerating structure. BINP developed this machine as a turn-a-key equipment. Technical details and test results will be presented.",
