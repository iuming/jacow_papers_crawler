Generally in DC and Pelletron accelerators Nitrogen/SF6 gas is taken out from accelerator tank and it is cooled by separate heat exchanger and blower unit outside the accelerator tank.

After successful lab tests the modulator is intended for use in cargo scanning and radiography applications. Currently the topology consists of 4 no.s of single turn primaries driven independently at voltages not more than 1000V.

One cavity has been made by UK industry and one has been made using the same process as the CLIC main linac in order to gain understanding of breakdown behaviour in X-band deflecting cavities.

Joining techniques of electron beam welding (EBW) and vacuum brazing are particularly important for these applications. These processes have been used in the accelerator community and developed into generally accepted “best practice”.

A cryomodule of eight superconducting RF Single Spoke Resonators of type 1 (SSR1) cavities operating at 325 MHz is an integral part of PXIE. Ten SSR1 cavities were manufactured in industry and delivered to Fermilab. We discuss tests of nine bare SSR1 cavities at the Fermilab Vertical Test Stand (VTS). Recently",

This requires preservation of the beam flatness during acceleration along the drift tube linac.

The discharge can take place on a single surface or between two surfaces. A novel coaxial resonator to investigate two-surface multipactor discharges on metal and dielectric surfaces in the gap region under vacuum conditions has been designed and tested. The resonator is ~ 100 mm in length with an outer diameter of ~ 60 mm (internal dimensions). A pulsed RF source delivers up to 30 W average power over a wide frequency range 650-900 MHz to the RF resonator. The incident and reflected RF signals are monitored by calibrated RF diodes. An electron probe provides temporal measurements of the multipacting electron current with respect to the RF power. These experiments were successful in identifying multipacting and allowed us the evaluation of a home made sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin layers as a Multipactor suppressor."

      "abstract": "Angiography is one of the most reliable and contemporary procedure of the vascular system imaging. X-ray spectrums provided by all modern medical angiographs are too broad to acquire high contrast images and provide low radiation dose at the same time. The new method of narrow X-ray spectrum achieving is based on the idea of channelling radiation application. The X-ray filters used in this method allows eliminating the high energy part of the spectrum and providing dramatic dose reduction. The scheme of the facility including the X-ray filter is discussed. The results of the spectrum analysis for the channelling radiation source and typical angiography X-ray tube are discussed. Doses obtained by the water phantom and contrast of the iodine agent image are also provided for both cases.",

AC power supply of the controller to heat the cooling water was operated at 2Hz by PWM control with alternatively tuning on and off. The correlation between beam position variation and a leakage magnetic field due to applying the heater current of an AC power supply was found out. Although the cooling water temperature was controlled less than ±40mK",

The algorithms are based on 2nd order polynomial functions and lookup tables with interpolation by which complex correction factors are obtained. The algorithms were tested in an actual setup including a 5 MW klystron and a superconducting 9-cell TESLA-type cavity at ASTA. By this a proof of concept was demonstrated."
