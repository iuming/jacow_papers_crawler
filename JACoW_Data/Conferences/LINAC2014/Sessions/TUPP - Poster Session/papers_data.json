        "The Argonne National Laboratory ATLAS accelerator’s Intensity and Efficiency Upgrade project has been successfully finished [1]. This upgrade substantially increases beam currents for experimenters working with the existing stable and in-flight rare isotope beams and for the neutron rich beams from the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder upgrade. A major portion of this project involved the replacement of three existing cryomodules",
        "containing 18 superconducting (SC) accelerator cavities and 9 superconducting solenoids",
        "with a single cryomodule containing 7 SC 72.75 MHz accelerator cavities optimized for ion velocities of 7.7% the speed of light and 4 SC solenoids all operating at 4.5 K. This paper reports the measured thermal load to the 4 K and 80 K coolant streams and compares these results to the pre-upgrade cryogenic system."

        "A cryomodule of seven 72 MHz SC quarter-wave cavities optimized for ions with v/c=0.077 has been commissioned in the ATLAS heavy-ion accelerator at Argonne. ATLAS has a new capability for increased beam currents with low beam losses for nuclear physics experiments using stable or rare isotope beams or neutron rich beams from the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder. The main goal for the cryomodule",
        "to provide an accelerating voltage of 17.5 MV (2.5 MV/cavity)",
        "with no detectable beam losses has been met within the first month of commissioning. Thus far",

For present levels there is practically no field emission (EPEAK=40 MV/m) and RF losses of ~5 Watts/cavity are only half of that planned. Cavity fields will continue to be gradually increased",
        "with the limits due to cavity quench measured at VACC=3.75 MV. Due to a combination of rf design and cavity processing",
        "effective voltages are now 2 ½ times those for any other operational cavities for this v/c. We report here on the recent online test results and technical features of the present design."

It comprises a 1-cell standing-wave (SW) section for rapid acceleration and a 13-cells travelling-wave (TW) section for further bunching and acceleration. This paper focuses on its rf tuning procedure. The tuning strategy combines a non-resonant bead-pull measurement of complex electric field and a linear model for local reflection coefficient calculation. The tuning result is satisfying. Field unflatness of the TW section has been improved from ±9% to ±4%",

The shot to shot and flat top current stability has to be better than 0.1% to guarantee the beam stability required for CLIC. Based on the experience with the CTF3 injector a thermionic high voltage gun with a gridded cathode has been designed together with a sub-harmonic bunching system to achieve these requirements. The grid will allow controlling the current and eventually feedback on the flattop shape. The gun will operate at 140 kV and an emittance of 14 mm mrad can be obtained. The paper describes the design approach and the results of the systematic electromagnetic simulations to optimize the gun. Care was taken during the mechanical design of the gun to obtain a modular design allowing adjusting for different beam currents and cathode sizes.",

The measurements were done with low intensity stable beams (~0.5 enA) in order to avoid compensation effects in the EBIS ion source and obtain representative measurements of the radioactive ion beam emittance. Emittances were measured using a slit-grid emittance meter and compared with results obtained with a quadrupole-scan (three-gradient) method. An analysis of the background suppression is presented and possible source of errors for both type of measurements are discussed.",

Two solutions have been found in accordance with the general theory of particle optics. Beam dynamics simulations with new quadrupole settings show an increased particle transmission through the RFQ. The results of numerical study have been confirmed during experimental campaigns. An improved performance of the whole HSI has been demonstrated. The proposed algorithm and a comparison of the measured data with result of simulations are presented."

It confirmed the optimization of the ECS (Energy Compression System) parameters. The single shot bunch-by-bunch vertical emittance measurement proved the difference between the front bunch and the following bunches. The same measurement showed a timing jitter of the electron gun pulse although the rf synchronization was perfect. This jittering had made the injection efficiency unstable."

This removes the need for an optical parametric amplifier system to provide a wavelength-tunable laser to vary the central frequency of the THz radiation. The practical feasibility and applications of this scheme is demonstrated numerically with a start-to-end simulation using the beam parameters at Shanghai Deep Ultraviolet Free-Electron Laser facility (SDUV). The central frequency of the density modulation can be continuously tuned by either varying the chirp of the beam or the momentum compactions of the chicanes. The influence of nonlinear RF chirp and longitudinal space charge effect have also been studied in our article. We also briefly discuss how one may retrieve the beam longitudinal phase space through measurement of the THz density modulation. \\end{abstract}"
