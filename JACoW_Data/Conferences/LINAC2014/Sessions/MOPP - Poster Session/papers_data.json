Now the LIS is used at routine operation of the RHIC-AGS accelerator complex and is providing stable less-contaminated beams. The laser power density was optimized to provide singly charged ions with low material consumption rate. The nominal laser energy on the target is around 500 mJ with 1064 nm Nd:YAG of the wave length. The induced plasma by the laser is transported through a 3 m pipe to stretch ion beam pulse length to match the EBIS’s requirement and the degradation of the beam current caused by the long drift section of the pipe can be compensated by a longitudinal magnetic filed induced by a coil surrounding the pipe. We also employed a twin laser system to extend the beam width further. At the conference",

Here we show how computer simulations can be used to determine the inside temperature so that Rs(Tin) can then be used to extract superconductor parameters.

        "the heat loads introduced by the high-power RF couplers represent an important fraction of the overall static thermal budget. Working at low operating temperature benefits from a reduced surface resistance (low dynamic losses) but is penalized by the high refrigeration cost. The external conductor of RF coaxial couplers provides a direct conduction path from ambient to cryogenic temperature plus is heated by resistive power deposition. Heat interception is therefore essential to contain heat in-leaks: a double-walled external conductor with a properly designed gas cooling effectively reduces heat loads to the cold bath by 1 order of magnitude. This paper presents the thermal design of the RF power coupler of the Superconducting Proton Linac (SPL) at CERN",

The pLINAC consists of an RFQ followed by six CH-DTL accelerating cavities and the electromagnetic field inside each cavity is generated by seven Klystrons providing up to 2.8 MW power at 325.224 MHz. The high power RF coupling between the Klystron and the accelerating CH-cavity has been studied and an inductive coupling loop has been designed. The coupler insertion inside the cavity and the rotation angle with respect to the magnetic field lines have been adjusted and the results of the analysis of the coupler positioning are presented. A prototype coupler is under construction and the measurement of RF coupling with the CH-cavity is scheduled within this year.",

The existing MEBT section was designed in 1996 and based on a novel concept called the superlens* which uses a magnetic quadrupol doublet lens combined with a short RFQ cavity for transversal and longitudinal focusing. In 2009 the RFQ section in front of the MEBT was upgraded which led to significant changes in the RFQ output particle distribution. Recent LORASR simulations show that the superlens transmission decreases to 90% (related to 20.75 mA",

The down side of this technology choice is that it produces a high density heat load on the target so that cooling and hydrogen aniti-blistering amelioration prevent sever challenges requiring successful R&D progress. The latest design of the target and moderator system shows that a flux of 4×109 epi-thermal neutrons / cm2 / sec can be obtained.

It is beneficial to identify possible source of emittance growth by cavity misalignment. Beam pipe modes which are localized in both ends of the cavity and TE111 1/9 pi mode which is localized in the center of the cavity are focused in this research. Deviations of these electrical centers from beam trajectory reference indicate cavity misalignment and bending. We measured beam-induced HOM in STF cavities of the STF accelerator at KEK in 2012 – 2013 and TESLA cavities of FLASH at DESY in 2013. We could identify beam pipe modes and TE111 1/9 pi mode in STF cavities and TESLA cavities at around 2.1 GHz and 1.6 GHz",

      "abstract": "The SARAF Prototype Superconducting Module (PSM) houses six 176 MHz Half Wave Resonators(HWR). The PSM accelerates protons and deuterons from 1.5 MeV/u to 4 and 5.6 MeV. The HWRs are highly sensitive to the coolant liquid Helium pressure fluctuations which limit the available beam power to 2kW per cavity out of 4kW RF amplifier and coupler and so might limit the available beam current to 2mA depending on the output energy. The flat shape of the cavity along the beam line in the area of the high electric field generates the high sensitivity of the Eigen mode frequency to helium pressure. The evaluated cavity sensitivity is full consistent with the measured values. It was explored that the tuning system (the fog structure) has a significant contribution to the cavity sensitivity. By using ribs or by modifying the rigidity of the fog we may reduce the HWR sensitivity by a factor of 3. This analysis is applied to study the stresses on the cavity during cool down and warm up to avoid plastic deformation as the Niobium yield is an order of magnitude lower in room temperature.",
