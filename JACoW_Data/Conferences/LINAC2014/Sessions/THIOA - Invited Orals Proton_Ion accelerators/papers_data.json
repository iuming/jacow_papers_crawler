        "FRIB is a $730M heavy ion accelerator project and a very large scale machine for many nuclear physics users. The civil construction started on March 17th 2014. The SRF system design and development have completed. The machine is to be in early completion end of 2019. FRIB accelerates ion species up to 238U with energies of no less than 200MeV/u and provides a beam power up to 400kW. Four SRF cavity families are used from β=0.041",
        "0.085 (QWRs) to 0.29 and 0.53 (HWRs). 8T superconducting solenoids are installed in the cryomodules for space effective strong beam focusing. The biggest challenges are in accelerating the high-power heavy ion beams from the very low energy to medium energy and the stable operation for large user community. The SRF cryomodule design addressed three critical issues: high performance",
        "stable operation and easy maintainability",
        "which chose several unique technical strategies",

        "Active discussion on the high energy physics priorities in the US carried out since summer of 2013 resulted in changes in Fermilab plans for future development of the existing accelerator complex. In particular",
        "the scope of Project X was reduced to the support of the Long Base Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at the project first stage. The name of the facility was changed to the PIP-II (Proton Improvement Plan). This new facility is a logical extension of the existing Proton Improvement Plan aimed at doubling average power of the Fermilab’s Booster and Main Injector (MI). Its design and required R&D are closely related to the Project X. The paper discusses the goals of this new facility and changes to the Project X linac introduced to support the goals."
