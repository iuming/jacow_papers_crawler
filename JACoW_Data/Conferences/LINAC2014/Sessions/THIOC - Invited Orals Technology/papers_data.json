      "abstract": "TRIUMF has developed Allison scanners to measure the transverse emittance of both low intensity hadron beams at 104 pps and high intensity electron beams at 10mA for a dynamic range of more than 1012 in intensity. The devices give high resolution transverse emittance information in a compact package that fits in a single diagnostic box. The talk will present the design and performance of the operating devices.",

        "The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) energy upgrade from 6 GeV to 12 GeV includes the installation of ten new 100 MV cryomodules (80 cavities). The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at an accelerating gradient of 19.3 MV/m with a QL of 3×107. The RF system employs single cavity control using new digital LLRF controls and 13 kW klystrons. Recently",
        "all of the new cryomodules and associated RF hardware and software have been commissioned and operated in the CEBAF accelerator. Electrons at linac currents up to 10 μA have been successfully accelerated and used for nuclear physics experiments. This paper reports on the commissioning and operation of the cryomodules and RF system."
