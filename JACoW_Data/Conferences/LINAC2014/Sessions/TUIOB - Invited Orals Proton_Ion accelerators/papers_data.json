        "C-ADS linac is under key technology development stage. At present it focuses on the construction of two injectors with proton energy 10 MeV. One injector goes to 325 MHz RFQ and Spoke cavity technology being developed by IHEP in Beijing. The other injector consists of 162.5 MHz  RFQ and HWR cavity being developed by IMP in Lanzhou.  The construction of the high current ECR proton source",
        "the CW RFQ accelerator",
        "superconducting HWR and spoke cavities have made a great progress. It is expected to start 5 MeV CW proton beam commissioning by the end of 2014 for the both injectors in terms of  current status. This paper presents the status of the R & D activities for the C-ADS linac."
