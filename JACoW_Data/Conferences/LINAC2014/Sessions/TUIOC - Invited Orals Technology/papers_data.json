        "the testing of quadrupoles will be almost finished",
        "and regular module testing will be established. Thus the talk should emphasize the quasi industrial testing of these components",
        "of course including a good overview about the used somewhat unique AMTF infrastructure."

        "a new technology for processing SRF cavities was developed at Fermilab",
        "which allows to achieve quality factors (Q) several times higher than those obtained by any other state-of-the-art cavity processing techniques. It is of direct and primary importance for all planned CW accelerators such as LCLS-II",
        "PIP-II",
        "and others since higher Q directly translates into lower wall dissipated power and hence much lower capital and operational costs for the refrigeration system. The technology is based on the slight modification to the standard vacuum degassing at 800C by performing its final part in the small partial pressure of nitrogen. In this talk we will present the most effective and robust recipes developed for single and multicell cavities",
        "and discuss possible underlying physical mechanisms of the drastic Q improvement as deduced by different structural (SIMS",
        "cryo-TEM) and superconducting (LE-muSR",
        "PCT) probes."
