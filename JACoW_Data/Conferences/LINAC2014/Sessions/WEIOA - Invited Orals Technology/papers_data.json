        "During the past few years we gained a qualitative understanding of the basic physics of breakdown phenomena in high vacuum RF structures. With this understanding we have been able to demonstrate accelerator structures with gradient extended to 175 MV/m",
        "well above the state of the art. This was accomplished with the understanding of geometrical effects and material properties. To push the gradient further",
        "the scaling lows developed to date requires us to increase the frequency to reduce the filing time and use very short pulses at the same order as the filling time. Indeed",
        "initial experimental investigation shows the possibility of a 1GV/m structure at W-band for a structure that operates for only 3 ns. The next stage of developments can not only address the next generation of high gradient structure technologies but also has to address the efficient production and utilization of RF power for linacs. We will present the development of RF accelerator structures aimed at operating frequency from mm-wave to THz. We also present the experimental results of novel rf sources aimed to be integrated with these structure for an efficient overall system."
