        "I will present on an experimental demonstration of a two-stage cascaded optical inverse free-electron laser (IFEL) accelerator in which an electron beam was accelerated by a strong laser pulse after being packed into optical microbunches by a weaker initial laser pulse. It was shown experimentally that injection of precisely prepared optical microbunches into an IFEL allows net acceleration or deceleration of the beam",
        "depending on the relative phase of the two laser pulses. Results indicate that with proper phase stability",
        "high efficiency compact IFELs may be obtainable with conventional laser sources.",

        "The X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have extended the wavelength tunability of laser sources to hard X-ray regions and have attracted many experimental users from laser science community as well as synchrotron radiation. In addition",
        "the seeding technique which was demonstrated in LCLS in 2012 has drastically improved the temporal coherence of XFELs. Nevertheless",
        "there still remains an important technical challenge in XFELs: How to control the pulse length",
        "especially toward shorter values? Recently",
        "several ideas have been proposed to resolve this issue by means of controlling the timing between X-ray and electron beams. This talk will review novel concepts toward future XFELs with attosecond and zeptosecond pulse lengths."

        "Ion acceleration by irradiating ultra-thin foils or gas jets with high intensity laser pulses has been receiving much attention lately. Using this technique",
        "beams of protons with energies up to ~60 MeV have been observed. Although not confirmed yet",
        "it is predicted that the energy can be increased by a factor of 5-10. At the moment the particle distributions produced by such accelerators hardly allows the use of the beam produced for applications like medical isotope production but steady progress in the field might change the situation in the near future. First experiments irradiating cell lines for cancer research with laser accelerated ions have been successfully performed and further experiments at 4 MeV to fit the requirements for radiobiology experiment have been proposed. Within the next 5 years laser based injectors delivering beams of ions at high intensity and repetition rate at energies of 30-40 MeV to conventional linac seem possible. The status of laser accelerated ions together with possible applications will be presented and an outlook on further developments given."

        "where the proton beam drives the plasma wakefields and creates a large accelerating field. This large gradient of ~GV/m can be achieved by relying on the self-modulation instability (SMI) of the proton beam; when seeded by ionization through a short laser pulse",
        "a train of micro-bunches with a period on the order of the plasma wavelength (~mm) develops",
