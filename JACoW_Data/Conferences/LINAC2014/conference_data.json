            "we have successfully commissioned a newly designed low charge high brightness laser ion source (LIS) which delivers various singly charged heavy ions to the electron beam ion source (EBIS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Now the LIS is used at routine operation of the RHIC-AGS accelerator complex and is providing stable less-contaminated beams. The laser power density was optimized to provide singly charged ions with low material consumption rate. The nominal laser energy on the target is around 500 mJ with 1064 nm Nd:YAG of the wave length. The induced plasma by the laser is transported through a 3 m pipe to stretch ion beam pulse length to match the EBIS’s requirement and the degradation of the beam current caused by the long drift section of the pipe can be compensated by a longitudinal magnetic filed induced by a coil surrounding the pipe. We also employed a twin laser system to extend the beam width further. At the conference",

The external conductor of RF coaxial couplers provides a direct conduction path from ambient to cryogenic temperature plus is heated by resistive power deposition. Heat interception is therefore essential to contain heat in-leaks: a double-walled external conductor with a properly designed gas cooling effectively reduces heat loads to the cold bath by 1 order of magnitude.

The pLINAC consists of an RFQ followed by six CH-DTL accelerating cavities and the electromagnetic field inside each cavity is generated by seven Klystrons providing up to 2.8 MW power at 325.224 MHz. The high power RF coupling between the Klystron and the accelerating CH-cavity has been studied and an inductive coupling loop has been designed. The coupler insertion inside the cavity and the rotation angle with respect to the magnetic field lines have been adjusted and the results of the analysis of the coupler positioning are presented. A prototype coupler is under construction and the measurement of RF coupling with the CH-cavity is scheduled within this year.",

In 2009 the RFQ section in front of the MEBT was upgraded which led to significant changes in the RFQ output particle distribution. Recent LORASR simulations show that the superlens transmission decreases to 90% (related to 20.75 mA",

This presentation gives a quantitative evaluation of the beam energy fluctuations in an electron linear accelerator caused by phase noises",

The interference between the accelerating RF phase modulation and the timing modulation of a beam bunch was found in the model analysis and also in the experimental results."

Due to the absence of dimple tuning no local frequency correction is possible and hence ultra-precise machining is required.

The required mechanical precision has been reached and the structure has been successfully power tested to a gradient larger than 50 MV/m",

A ring has been designed based on the new concept that accelerates a proton beam from 500 MeV to 1 GeV in four turns using multi-cell superconducting cavities in each period.

            "the ring can be considered as a “wrapped-up” linac at four times the ring circumference. In this paper we present beam dynamics modelling details when using 3D linac codes and cavity field maps. We conclude that the versatility of codes such as TraceWin",

It is beneficial to identify possible source of emittance growth by cavity misalignment. Beam pipe modes which are localized in both ends of the cavity and TE111 1/9 pi mode which is localized in the center of the cavity are focused in this research. Deviations of these electrical centers from beam trajectory reference indicate cavity misalignment and bending. We measured beam-induced HOM in STF cavities of the STF accelerator at KEK in 2012 – 2013 and TESLA cavities of FLASH at DESY in 2013. We could identify beam pipe modes and TE111 1/9 pi mode in STF cavities and TESLA cavities at around 2.1 GHz and 1.6 GHz",

The HWRs are highly sensitive to the coolant liquid Helium pressure fluctuations which limit the available beam power to 2kW per cavity out of 4kW RF amplifier and coupler and so might limit the available beam current to 2mA depending on the output energy. The flat shape of the cavity along the beam line in the area of the high electric field generates the high sensitivity of the Eigen mode frequency to helium pressure. The evaluated cavity sensitivity is full consistent with the measured values. It was explored that the tuning system (the fog structure) has a significant contribution to the cavity sensitivity. By using ribs or by modifying the rigidity of the fog we may reduce the HWR sensitivity by a factor of 3. This analysis is applied to study the stresses on the cavity during cool down and warm up to avoid plastic deformation as the Niobium yield is an order of magnitude lower in room temperature.",

            "LINACII at DESY currently provides 450 MeV electrons for the synchrotron radiation source PETRAIII. The injector upgrade of it aims to improve its reliability and mitigate the radiological activation due to electron losses at hundreds of MeV. Therefore",
            "a 2.998 GHz hybrid buncher has been developed and will be installed in between a pre-buncher and LINAC II. It comprises a 1-cell standing-wave (SW) section for rapid acceleration and a 13-cells travelling-wave (TW) section for further bunching and acceleration. This paper focuses on its rf tuning procedure. The tuning strategy combines a non-resonant bead-pull measurement of complex electric field and a linear model for local reflection coefficient calculation. The tuning result is satisfying. Field unflatness of the TW section has been improved from ±9% to ±4%",
            "and field in the SW section has been enhanced significantly. By using ASTRA simulation",
            "it has been verified that the residual detuning of the structure is acceptable in view of beam dynamics performance."

The shot to shot and flat top current stability has to be better than 0.1% to guarantee the beam stability required for CLIC. Based on the experience with the CTF3 injector a thermionic high voltage gun with a gridded cathode has been designed together with a sub-harmonic bunching system to achieve these requirements. The grid will allow controlling the current and eventually feedback on the flattop shape. The gun will operate at 140 kV and an emittance of 14 mm mrad can be obtained. The paper describes the design approach and the results of the systematic electromagnetic simulations to optimize the gun. Care was taken during the mechanical design of the gun to obtain a modular design allowing adjusting for different beam currents and cathode sizes.",

A prototype based on a commercial ACCT and EPICS-integrated MTCA.4 electronics has been set up and successfully tested with an emulated beam.

In this paper we review misalignment tolerances of LCLS-II SC linac and discuss possible beam-based alignment algorithm to meet these tolerances.",

To examine the efficiency of various diagnostic devices an injector test facility (ITF) was constructed. The last part of the ITF is dedicated for evaluation of beam position measurement devices. A “3-BPM-study” was done with 3 Libera Single Pass E BPM modules that were connected to the 3 equidistantly positioned stripline sensors. The aim of the test was to measure the performances of the Libera Single Pass E devices with beam conditions similar to the real pal XFEL machine."

It confirmed the optimization of the ECS (Energy Compression System) parameters. The single shot bunch-by-bunch vertical emittance measurement proved the difference between the front bunch and the following bunches. The same measurement showed a timing jitter of the electron gun pulse although the rf synchronization was perfect. This jittering had made the injection efficiency unstable."

This removes the need for an optical parametric amplifier system to provide a wavelength-tunable laser to vary the central frequency of the THz radiation. The practical feasibility and applications of this scheme is demonstrated numerically with a start-to-end simulation using the beam parameters at Shanghai Deep Ultraviolet Free-Electron Laser facility (SDUV). The central frequency of the density modulation can be continuously tuned by either varying the chirp of the beam or the momentum compactions of the chicanes. The influence of nonlinear RF chirp and longitudinal space charge effect have also been studied in our article. We also briefly discuss how one may retrieve the beam longitudinal phase space through measurement of the THz density modulation. \\end{abstract}"

An X-band system has been chosen for the crab cavities. Three prototype cavities have been developed in order to test the high power characteristics of these cavities. One cavity has been made by UK industry and one has been made using the same process as the CLIC main linac in order to gain understanding of breakdown behaviour in X-band deflecting cavities.

Joining techniques of electron beam welding (EBW) and vacuum brazing are particularly important for these applications. These processes have been used in the accelerator community and developed into generally accepted “best practice”.

            "the cavity was tested with a preliminary aluminum drift tube structure",
            "which was used for precise frequency and field tuning. In 2013 the final drift tube structure has been welded inside the main tanks and the preparation for copper plating has taken place. This paper will report on the main tuning and commissioning steps towards that novel type of DTL and it will show the latest results measured on a fully operational and copper plated CH proton cavity."

            "Recently a scheme for creation of flat ion beams from linacs has been proposed to increase the efficiency of multi-turn-injection. The proof of principle experiment shall be performed at GSI in Summer 2014. Since the scheme requires charge stripping",
            "it may be necessary to perform the round-to-flat transformation prior to acceleration to the final energy of the linac. This requires preservation of the beam flatness during acceleration along the drift tube linac. This contribution is on simulations of acceleration of flat beams subject to considerable space charge tune depression. It is shown that the flatness can be preserved if the transverse tunes are properly chosen and if mis-match along inter-tank sections is minimized along the DTL."

A novel coaxial resonator to investigate two-surface multipactor discharges on metal and dielectric surfaces in the gap region under vacuum conditions has been designed and tested. The resonator is ~ 100 mm in length with an outer diameter of ~ 60 mm (internal dimensions). A pulsed RF source delivers up to 30 W average power over a wide frequency range 650-900 MHz to the RF resonator. The incident and reflected RF signals are monitored by calibrated RF diodes. An electron probe provides temporal measurements of the multipacting electron current with respect to the RF power. These experiments were successful in identifying multipacting and allowed us the evaluation of a home made sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin layers as a Multipactor suppressor."

Measurements and calculations of a field emission strip cathode based on carbon structure and a unit for its investigation are presented in the article. For measuring of the cathode emitting properties and determination of the electrons initial parameters used in the electron beam computer simulation the experimental setup is been developed. The setup consists of the high-voltage triode electrode system and allows to investigate the voltage-current characteristics of the cathode and to estimate the electron distribution of the beam on the anode surface. The anode electron distribution evaluations are processed by the measurements of the emitted X-ray focal spot on the anode by application of the CCD camera. Verification of the simulated electron beam dynamics can be obtained by application of the experimentally acquired data.",

First experiments irradiating cell lines for cancer research with laser accelerated ions have been successfully performed and further experiments at 4 MeV to fit the requirements for radiobiology experiment have been proposed. Within the next 5 years laser based injectors delivering beams of ions at high intensity and repetition rate at energies of 30-40 MeV to conventional linac seem possible.

Such beams were created successfully in electron machines by applying effective stand-alone solenoid fringe fields in the electron gun. Extension of this method to ion beams was proposed conceptually. The present paper is on the decoupling capabilities of an ion beam emittance transfer line. The proposed beam line provides a single-knob tool to partition the horizontal and vertical rms emittances",

Now the LIS is used at routine operation of the RHIC-AGS accelerator complex and is providing stable less-contaminated beams. The laser power density was optimized to provide singly charged ions with low material consumption rate. The nominal laser energy on the target is around 500 mJ with 1064 nm Nd:YAG of the wave length. The induced plasma by the laser is transported through a 3 m pipe to stretch ion beam pulse length to match the EBIS’s requirement and the degradation of the beam current caused by the long drift section of the pipe can be compensated by a longitudinal magnetic filed induced by a coil surrounding the pipe. We also employed a twin laser system to extend the beam width further. At the conference",

        "it was approximated that the surface temperature on the inner surface of the cavity is the same as the temperature of the bath. This is a good approximation at small RF-field losses on the surface",

Here we show how computer simulations can be used to determine the inside temperature so that Rs(Tin) can then be used to extract superconductor parameters. The computer code combines the well-known programs HEAT and SRIMP. We find that the error of the incorrect fitting method is about 10% at high RF-fields."

Working at low operating temperature benefits from a reduced surface resistance (low dynamic losses) but is penalized by the high refrigeration cost. The external conductor of RF coaxial couplers provides a direct conduction path from ambient to cryogenic temperature plus is heated by resistive power deposition. Heat interception is therefore essential to contain heat in-leaks: a double-walled external conductor with a properly designed gas cooling effectively reduces heat loads to the cold bath by 1 order of magnitude.

The existing MEBT section was designed in 1996 and based on a novel concept called the superlens* which uses a magnetic quadrupol doublet lens combined with a short RFQ cavity for transversal and longitudinal focusing. In 2009 the RFQ section in front of the MEBT was upgraded which led to significant changes in the RFQ output particle distribution. Recent LORASR simulations show that the superlens transmission decreases to 90% (related to 20.75 mA",
        "U4+ at input). Moreover",
        "the matching to the following IH-DTL is not ideal. This leads to further losses in the IH and to a decrease of the overall UNILAC efficiency. To reach the FAIR requirement of 18 mA U4+ current for the UNILAC with minimal losses and to provide more flexibility for varying current level operation",
        "a new design based on two magnetic quadrupole triplet lenses and a 2-gap buncher is proposed. The design shows full transmission at 20.75 mA U4+ current and improved matching to the IH-DTL",

        "replacing 36-year-old amplifiers to improve their reliability as a main injector for the RIBF accelerator complex. The RILAC is a DC machine and their frequency are tunable between 18 to 40 MHz so as to be capable of accelerating heavy ions with mass-to-charge (m/q) ratios up to 28. The new rf amplifier is based on a tetrode THALES/SIEMENS RS2042SK coupled with a tetrode THALES/SIEMENS RS2012CJ with a grounded grid circuit. The maximum output power is 100 kW with a frequency ranging from 18 to 40 MHz. The amplifier was originally designed for RIKEN Ring Cyclotron. Since we have many experiences with this type of amplifier",
        "some modification to avoid exciting the parasitic modes which might damage the cavity and/or the amplifier itself. Their construction started in April 2013 and installation was performed in January 2014. After the installation their commissioning has been successfully made. For a beam service started in this March the new amplifiers were operated without any troubles. [1]M. Odera et al.",

It is beneficial to identify possible source of emittance growth by cavity misalignment. Beam pipe modes which are localized in both ends of the cavity and TE111 1/9 pi mode which is localized in the center of the cavity are focused in this research. Deviations of these electrical centers from beam trajectory reference indicate cavity misalignment and bending. We measured beam-induced HOM in STF cavities of the STF accelerator at KEK in 2012 – 2013 and TESLA cavities of FLASH at DESY in 2013.

      "abstract": "The SARAF Prototype Superconducting Module (PSM) houses six 176 MHz Half Wave Resonators(HWR). The PSM accelerates protons and deuterons from 1.5 MeV/u to 4 and 5.6 MeV. The HWRs are highly sensitive to the coolant liquid Helium pressure fluctuations which limit the available beam power to 2kW per cavity out of 4kW RF amplifier and coupler and so might limit the available beam current to 2mA depending on the output energy. The flat shape of the cavity along the beam line in the area of the high electric field generates the high sensitivity of the Eigen mode frequency to helium pressure. The evaluated cavity sensitivity is full consistent with the measured values. It was explored that the tuning system (the fog structure) has a significant contribution to the cavity sensitivity. By using ribs or by modifying the rigidity of the fog we may reduce the HWR sensitivity by a factor of 3. This analysis is applied to study the stresses on the cavity during cool down and warm up to avoid plastic deformation as the Niobium yield is an order of magnitude lower in room temperature.",

New approach based on covariant formulation of the Vlasov equation* is developed. Such approach allows using various coordinates in the phase space. It is shown how to apply this approach to the problem of finding of solutions of the Vlasov equation for charged particle beam. Solutions obtained within the framework of this approach are presented. Most known example is the Kapchinsky-Vladimirsky distribution. Wide classes of distributions for uniformly charged beam are also considered.",

        "LINACII at DESY currently provides 450 MeV electrons for the synchrotron radiation source PETRAIII. The injector upgrade of it aims to improve its reliability and mitigate the radiological activation due to electron losses at hundreds of MeV. Therefore",
        "a 2.998 GHz hybrid buncher has been developed and will be installed in between a pre-buncher and LINAC II. It comprises a 1-cell standing-wave (SW) section for rapid acceleration and a 13-cells travelling-wave (TW) section for further bunching and acceleration. This paper focuses on its rf tuning procedure. The tuning strategy combines a non-resonant bead-pull measurement of complex electric field and a linear model for local reflection coefficient calculation. The tuning result is satisfying. Field unflatness of the TW section has been improved from ±9% to ±4%",
        "and field in the SW section has been enhanced significantly. By using ASTRA simulation",
        "it has been verified that the residual detuning of the structure is acceptable in view of beam dynamics performance."

The shot to shot and flat top current stability has to be better than 0.1% to guarantee the beam stability required for CLIC. Based on the experience with the CTF3 injector a thermionic high voltage gun with a gridded cathode has been designed together with a sub-harmonic bunching system to achieve these requirements. The grid will allow controlling the current and eventually feedback on the flattop shape. The gun will operate at 140 kV and an emittance of 14 mm mrad can be obtained. The paper describes the design approach and the results of the systematic electromagnetic simulations to optimize the gun. Care was taken during the mechanical design of the gun to obtain a modular design allowing adjusting for different beam currents and cathode sizes.",

The FCT will have a larger bandwidth and it will be used to measure the performance of the fast chopper of the Medium Energy Beam Transport with a rise time of 10 ns. A prototype based on a commercial ACCT and EPICS-integrated MTCA.4 electronics has been set up and successfully tested with an emulated beam. The ACCT signal has been FPGA processed to compensate for the offset and droop as well as filtering and synchronization to an external trigger. This paper gives an overview of the design and test results of the prototype ACCT system with an outlook to future modifications before installation in the ESS Linac."

A digital LLRF system designed by industry was integrated into an existing amplifier driving a single gap resonator and was tested including ion beam tests. An overview of the RF system design and of the planned upgrades will be reported including some results of the LLRF tests."

The superposition of the measured magnetic fields of each quadrupole was taken into account. The quadrupole settings were optimized using the Monte-Carlo method. Two solutions have been found in accordance with the general theory of particle optics. Beam dynamics simulations with new quadrupole settings show an increased particle transmission through the RFQ. The results of numerical study have been confirmed during experimental campaigns. An improved performance of the whole HSI has been demonstrated. The proposed algorithm and a comparison of the measured data with result of simulations are presented."

We report how we use the system and its contribution to the stable top-up operation. The beam loading effect on the bunch energy was obtained by bunch-by-bunch energy profile measurements. It confirmed the optimization of the ECS (Energy Compression System) parameters. The single shot bunch-by-bunch vertical emittance measurement proved the difference between the front bunch and the following bunches. The same measurement showed a timing jitter of the electron gun pulse although the rf synchronization was perfect. This jittering had made the injection efficiency unstable."

This removes the need for an optical parametric amplifier system to provide a wavelength-tunable laser to vary the central frequency of the THz radiation. The practical feasibility and applications of this scheme is demonstrated numerically with a start-to-end simulation using the beam parameters at Shanghai Deep Ultraviolet Free-Electron Laser facility (SDUV). The central frequency of the density modulation can be continuously tuned by either varying the chirp of the beam or the momentum compactions of the chicanes. The influence of nonlinear RF chirp and longitudinal space charge effect have also been studied in our article. We also briefly discuss how one may retrieve the beam longitudinal phase space through measurement of the THz density modulation. \\end{abstract}"

        "The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) energy upgrade from 6 GeV to 12 GeV includes the installation of ten new 100 MV cryomodules (80 cavities). The superconducting RF cavities are designed to operate CW at an accelerating gradient of 19.3 MV/m with a QL of 3×107. The RF system employs single cavity control using new digital LLRF controls and 13 kW klystrons. Recently",
        "all of the new cryomodules and associated RF hardware and software have been commissioned and operated in the CEBAF accelerator. Electrons at linac currents up to 10 μA have been successfully accelerated and used for nuclear physics experiments. This paper reports on the commissioning and operation of the cryomodules and RF system."

An X-band system has been chosen for the crab cavities. Three prototype cavities have been developed in order to test the high power characteristics of these cavities. One cavity has been made by UK industry and one has been made using the same process as the CLIC main linac in order to gain understanding of breakdown behaviour in X-band deflecting cavities. The final cavity incorporates mode-damping waveguides on each cell which will eventually contain SiC dampers. This paper details the design",

Joining techniques of electron beam welding (EBW) and vacuum brazing are particularly important for these applications. These processes have been used in the accelerator community and developed into generally accepted “best practice”. Studies were performed to update the existing knowledge, and comprehensively characterise these joints via mechanical and metallurgical investigations using modern available technologies. The developed solutions are described in detail, some currently being applied uniquely at CERN."

        "it may be necessary to perform the round-to-flat transformation prior to acceleration to the final energy of the linac. This requires preservation of the beam flatness during acceleration along the drift tube linac. This contribution is on simulations of acceleration of flat beams subject to considerable space charge tune depression. It is shown that the flatness can be preserved if the transverse tunes are properly chosen and if mis-match along inter-tank sections is minimized along the DTL."

        "from the MHz range to tens of GHz",
        "and in wide array of geometries if the impacted surface has a secondary electron emission (SEE) yield larger than one. The discharge can take place on a single surface or between two surfaces. A novel coaxial resonator to investigate two-surface multipactor discharges on metal and dielectric surfaces in the gap region under vacuum conditions has been designed and tested. The resonator is ~ 100 mm in length with an outer diameter of ~ 60 mm (internal dimensions). A pulsed RF source delivers up to 30 W average power over a wide frequency range 650-900 MHz to the RF resonator. The incident and reflected RF signals are monitored by calibrated RF diodes. An electron probe provides temporal measurements of the multipacting electron current with respect to the RF power. These experiments were successful in identifying multipacting and allowed us the evaluation of a home made sputtered titanium nitride (TiN) thin layers as a Multipactor suppressor."

        "there will be higher order mode (HOM) power deposited by the beam. Due to the very short bunch length the LCLS-II beam spectrum extends into the THz range. Ceramic absorbers",

        "however",
        "is a challenging task. In this report we calculate the amount of power radiated by the beam in the different portions of the linac as the bunch length is changed by the bunch compressors. We consider both the steady state radiation as well as transients that arise at the beginning of the linac structures. In addition",
        "transitions due to changes in the vacuum chamber aperture at the ends of the linacs are also considered. Finally",
        "under the assumption that all the wake power ends up in the SRF cavity walls",

Measurements and calculations of a field emission strip cathode based on carbon structure and a unit for its investigation are presented in the article. For measuring of the cathode emitting properties and determination of the electrons initial parameters used in the electron beam computer simulation the experimental setup is been developed. The setup consists of the high-voltage triode electrode system and allows to investigate the voltage-current characteristics of the cathode and to estimate the electron distribution of the beam on the anode surface. The anode electron distribution evaluations are processed by the measurements of the emitted X-ray focal spot on the anode by application of the CCD camera. Verification of the simulated electron beam dynamics can be obtained by application of the experimentally acquired data.",

First experiments irradiating cell lines for cancer research with laser accelerated ions have been successfully performed and further experiments at 4 MeV to fit the requirements for radiobiology experiment have been proposed. Within the next 5 years laser based injectors delivering beams of ions at high intensity and repetition rate at energies of 30-40 MeV to conventional linac seem possible.

        "To meet the tremendous world energy needs",
        "systematic R&D has to be pursued to replace fossil fuels. Nuclear energy",
        "which produces no green house gases and no air pollution",
        "should be a leading candidate. How nuclear energy",
        "based on thorium rather than uranium",
        "could be an acceptable solution is discussed. Thorium can be used both to produce energy or to destroy nuclear waste. The thorium conference",
        "organized by iThEC at CERN in October 2013",
        "has shown that thorium is seriously considered by developing countries as a key element of their energy strategy. However",
        "developed countries do not seem to move in that direction",
        "while global cooperation is highly desirable in this domain. As thorium is not fissile",
        "an elegant option is to use a proton accelerator to drive an “Accelerator Driven System (ADS)”",
        "as suggested by Nobel Prize laureate Carlo Rubbia. Therefore",
        "the accelerator community has an important challenge to meet: provide the required proton beam for ADS."
