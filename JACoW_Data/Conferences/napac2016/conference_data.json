            "Oxygen plasmas have shown promise for removing surface hydrocarbons from niobium in superconducting RF cavities. These techniques are candidates for in-situ cleaning techniques for installed accelerating cavities. The goal is to improve the performance of cavities that have degraded over time",

The FSSS method utilizes a single electron beam to generate a strong seed pulse and amplify it with a small energy spread electron slice. This extends the capability of self seeded XFELs by producing short pulses",
            "not limited by the duration set by the self-seeding monochromator system",
            "with high peak intensity. The scheme relies on using a parallel plate dechirper to impart a spatial chirp on the beam",
            "and appropriate orbit control to lase with different electron beam slices before and after the self-seeding monochromator. The performance of the FSSS method is analyzed with start-to-end simulations for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The simulations include the effect of the parallel plate dechirper and propagation of the radiation field through the monochromator. We also present results of the first successful demonstration of FSSS at LCLS. The radiation properties of FSSS X-ray pulses are compared with the Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) mode of FEL operation for the same electron beam parameters."

This paper examines the single-particle dynamics of such beams in non-axisymmetric lattice elements. The work supports commissioning activities at the FRIB Front End by illustrating how xy projections of the components of a multi-species beam become tilted due to dipoles and quadrupoles",
            "which can complicate charge state selection with slits. The results help guide simulations performed using the PIC code WARP to achieve better optimization of the collimation in the charge selection system (CSS). Beam statistical angular momentum also evolves in the CSS which in turn changes the x- and y-plane emittances. Possible implications of this effect on the final thermalized beam emittances delivered by the Front End are discussed."

The peak brightness of the ICS source can be maximized then if the electron phase space is transformed in a way so that all electrons scatter off the x-ray photons of same frequency in the same direction. We describe the x-ray photon beam quality through the Wigner function (6d photon phase space distribution) and derive it for the ICS source when the electron and laser rms matrices are arbitrary. We find the optimal uncorrelated electron beam phase space distribution resulting in the highest brightness of the ICS source for the simple on axis case as an example."

The goals for the pro-gram include calculating worst case thermal loading conditions and finding minimum shielding heights for photon absorbers. The program computes the deviation possibilities of synchrotron radiation rays emitted along bending magnet paths using discretized local phase space ellipses. The sizes of the ellipses are computed based on multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice parameters and the limiting aperture size within the future storage ring vacuum system. For absorber height calculations",
            "rays are projected from each point in the discretized ellipse to the locations of downstream absorbers. The absorber heights are mini-mized while protecting downstream components from all possible rays. For heat loads",
            "rays are projected until they hit a vacuum chamber wall. The area and linear power densities are calculated based on a ray's distance trav-elled and striking incidence angle. A set of worse case local heat loads is collected revealing a maximum condi-tion that each vacuum component must be designed to withstand."

A prototype DC/DC power supply utilizing a MOSFET H-bridge circuit with a 500 kHz PWM has been developed and tested successfully.

In the course of the operation of these systems, there comes a time when vari-ous instruments have to be temporarily attached for diag-nostic purposes: RGAs, leak detectors, and additional pumps. In an effort to make the additions of these instru-ments easier and more time effective, we propose to use KF style flanges for these types of temporary diagnostic connections. This document will describe the tests used to compare the particles generated using the assembly of the, widely accepted for 'particle free' use, conflat flange to the proposed KF style flange, and demonstrate that KF flanges produce less particles. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The strong electromagnetic fields in the SRF cavities will extract electrons from the cavity walls and will accelerate those. Most dark current will be deposited locally",

During the acceleration the Radio Frequency (RF) cavities are swept from 38MHz to 52.8MHz and requires crossing through transition where accelerating phase is shifted 90 degrees. In order to keep the beam stable and minimize losses and emittance growth a longitudinal damping system is required. This has traditionally been done by dedicated analog electronics designed to operate on specific beam modes for frequencies of instabilities. A complete digital implementation has been developed for this same purpose. The new digital system features and performance are detailed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Optical misalignment and phase stability are two critical issues that need to be addressed. Herriott cells are implemented for their relaxed alignment tolerance and a phase stabilization method based on cavity output pattern matching has been developed. A single pulse with intensity enhancement factor over 7.4 has been generated by stacking 13 modulated pules through a four-cavity stacking system. This can be a possible path for generating TW KHz laser pulses for a future laser-driven plasma accelerator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The high intensity gamma-ray beam is produced using Compton scattering between the electron and FEL photon beams. The beam displacement and angle at the collision point need to be maintained constant during the gamma-ray beam production. The magnetic field of the copper bussbars carrying the current to the FEL wigglers can impact the beam orbit. The compensation scheme in-general is complicated. In this work",
            "we report preliminary results of a bussbar compensation scheme for one of the wiggler and power supply configurations. Significant reductions of the orbit distortions have been realized using this compensation."

Using 3D spin rotators, one can, at the same time, efficiently control the polarization direction as well as the spin tune value. The 3D spin rotators allow one to arrange a system for reversals of the spin direction in all beam bunches during an experiment, i.e. a spin-flipping system. To preserve the polarization, one has to satisfy the condition of adiabatic change of the spin direction. When adjusting the polarization direction, one can stabilize the spin tune value, which completely eliminates resonant beam depolarization during the spin manipulation process. We provide the results of numerical modeling of a spin-flipping system in the JLEIC ion collider ring. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of organizing a spin-flipping system using a 3D rota-tor. The figure-8 JLEIC collider provides a unique capability of doing high-precision experiments with polarized ion beams. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The latter requires a small beam size at the interaction point demanding a strong final focus (FF) quadrupole system. The strong beam focusing in the FF unavoidably creates a large chromaticity which has to be compensated in order to avoid a severe degradation of momentum acceptance. This has to be done while preserving sufficient dynamic aperture. An additional design requirement for the chromaticity compensation optics in the electron ring is preservation of the low beam emittance. This paper reviews the development and selection of a chromaticity correction scheme for the electron collider ring."

The electron accelerator of the eRHIC will be based on a 1.665 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) placed in the RHIC tunnel and two Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) recirculating rings placed alongside the RHIC accelerator. The electron bunches reach the 20 GeV energy after passing 12 times through the ERL by recirculation in the FFAG rings. The FFAG rings consist of FODO cells comprised of one focusing and one defocusing quadrupoles made of permanent magnet material. Similarly other sections of the electron accelerator will utilize permanent magnets. In this presentation we will discuss details on the design of these magnets and their advantages over the current-excited magnets. 1. <http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1409/1409.1633.pdf> reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

            "the RFQ is expected to enable CW operation. Simulations with the beam dynamics code TRACK predict that a misalignment of the beam at the RFQ entrance can possibly deteriorate the transverse and longitudinal emittance at the RFQ exit without necessarily impacting the beam transmission. This paper discusses the procedure developed at Fermilab to align the beam in the electrical axes of the RFQ. Experimental results are shown together with predictions from TRACK."

The aim of the first experiments is to detect and study the self-modulation instability (SMI) of the long proton bunch ~12cm in a plasma with wakefields of period of ~1.2mm. The occurrence of SMI results in the formation of a charge core surrounded by a halo in the time-integrated images of the proton bunch transverse profile. Transverse profiles are obtained from scintillator screens and from optical transition radiation (OTR). The OTR is time resolved using a ps-resolution streak camera to determine the start of the wakefields along the bunch on a slow time scale (~ns)",

            "the location of the seeding of the SMI generated by the ionizing laser pulse. The modulation period is measured using the faster time scale (~ps). Coherent transition radiation (CTR) is analyzed by a heterodyne system to also yield the modulation frequency. Later experiments will sample the wakefields generated by externally injecting low-energy (~15MeV) electrons expected to be accelerated to the GeV energy level over the 10m-long plasma. Progress toward the completion of the experimental set-up will be presented."

We investigate the scaling laws of the accelerating and focusing fields in the novel ''crunch-in'' regime [1] [2]. This regime is excited due to the collapse of the electron-rings from the channel walls onto the propagation axis of the energy-source in its wake. This regime is thus the non-linearly driven hollow channel",

We present the properties of the coherent structures in the ''crunch-in'' regime where the channel radius is matched to the beam properties such that channel-edge to on-axis collapse time has a direct correspondence to the energy source intensity. We also investigate the physical mechanisms that underlie the ''crunch-in'' wakefields by tuning the channel radius. Using a theoretical framework and results from PIC simulations the possible applications of the ''crunch-in'' regime for acceleration of positron beams with collider-scale parameters is presented.",

Slip stacking with 12 Booster batches per 1.33 sec cycle of the Main Injector has been implemented and extensive operation with 8 batches and 10 batches per MI cycle has been demonstrated. Operation in this mode since 2013 shows that loss localization is an essential component for long term operation. Beam loss in the Recycler will be localized in a collimation region with design capability for absorbing up to 2 kW of lost protons in a pair of 20-Ton collimators (absorbers). This system will employ a two stage collimation with a thin Mo scattering foil to define the bottom edge of both the injected and decelerated-for-slipping beams.

To restore it the nonlinear elements can be employed which move back tunes of large amplitude particles. In the present report we consider the possibility of creating a \"nonlinear integrable optics\" insertion in the Fermilab Recycler to host either octupoles or hollow electron lens for this purpose. For comparison we also consider the classic scheme with distributed octupole families. It is shown that for the Proton Improvement Plan II parameters the required nonlinear tuneshift can be created without destroying the dynamic aperture. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

            "and Monte Carlo methods are used to provide small corrections to the predictions of the transfer map",
            "accounting for the stochastic nature of scattering and straggling of particles. This way the vast majority of the dynamics is represented by fast application of the high-order transfer map of an entire element and accumulated stochastic effects. The gains in speed simplify the optimization of muon cooling channels which are usually very computationally demanding. Progress on the development of the required algorithms is reported."

In this paper we present the simulation of a Skew-PIC channel using G4beamline. We implemented the required magnetic field components into G4beamline and compare the tracking of muons by the two different codes. We optimize the cooling channel and present the muon cooling effect in the Skew-PIC channel for the first time."

While existing models anticipate a direct relationship between these two parameters we observed an inverse relationship. We believe this is a result of damage to the barium coating on the cathode surface caused by a change in back-bombardment power that is unaccounted for in the existing theories. These observations shed new light on the challenges and fundamental limitations associated with scaling an un-gated thermionic cathode RF gun to high average current."

The 3rd harmonic cavity for the LCLS-II accelerator at SLAC will operate in a continuous wave (CW) regime. A CW operation and a high average current in the LCLS-II linac result in in-creased heat loads to main and HOM couplers of the cavity. Several cavity design modifications were pro-posed and investigated for improving a cavity perfor-mance in the CW regime.

A method is offered based on Gaussian approximation of the original particle distribution in the phase space (Klimontovich distribution) which leads to an equation for the σ matrix which provides efficient suppression of the tails and cannot be obtained by introducing weights. This equation is easily solved by iterations in the multi-dimensional case. It is also shown how the eigen-emittances and coupled optics functions can be retrieved from the σ matrix in a strongly coupled system. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

To achieve the 700 MW beam power goals for the NOvA neutrino oscillation experiment, the Recycler accumulates 12 batches of 80-bunch trains from the Booster using slip-stacking. One set of bunch trains are injected into the ring and decelerated, then a second set is injected at the nominal momentum. The trains slip past each other longitudinally due to their momenta difference. We have recently extended the multi-bunch portion of the Synergia beam simulation program to allow co-propagation of bunch trains at different momenta. In doing so, we have expanded the applicability of the massively parallel multi-bunch physics portion of Synergia to include new categories of bunch-bunch interactions. We present results from our first application of these capabilities to batch-on-batch slip stacking in the Recycler.",

One promising application of integrable optics is to overcome the traditional limits on accelerator intensity imposed by betatron tune-spread and collective instabilities. The efficacy of high-intensity integrable accelerators will be undergo comprehensive testing over the next several years at the Fermilab Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). We propose an integrable RCS (iRCS) as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide a overview of the machine parameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization.

PIP-II aims at enhancing the capabilities of the Fermilab existing accelerator complex while simultaneously providing a flexible platform for its future upgrades. The central part of PIP-II project is the construction of a new 800 MeV H− Superconducting (SC) Linac together with upgrades of the Booster and Main Injector synchrotrons. New transfer lines will also be needed to deliver beam to the downstream accelerators and facilities. In this paper we present the recent development of the design of the transfer lines discussing the principles that guided their design",

The FSSS method utilizes a single electron beam to generate a strong seed pulse and amplify it with a small energy spread electron slice. This extends the capability of self seeded XFELs by producing short pulses",
        "not limited by the duration set by the self-seeding monochromator system",
        "with high peak intensity. The scheme relies on using a parallel plate dechirper to impart a spatial chirp on the beam",
        "and appropriate orbit control to lase with different electron beam slices before and after the self-seeding monochromator. The performance of the FSSS method is analyzed with start-to-end simulations for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The simulations include the effect of the parallel plate dechirper and propagation of the radiation field through the monochromator. We also present results of the first successful demonstration of FSSS at LCLS. The radiation properties of FSSS X-ray pulses are compared with the Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) mode of FEL operation for the same electron beam parameters."

        "The potential for higher operating temperatures and increased accelerating gradient has attracted SRF researchers to Nb3Sn coatings on niobium for nearly 50 years. The two-step tin vapor diffusion: nucleation followed by deposition appears to be a promising technique to prepare Nb3Sn coatings on interior cavity surface. We have undertaken a fundamental materials study of the nucleation and deposition steps. Nucleation was accomplished within parameter ranges: 300 - 500 °C",

This paper examines the single-particle dynamics of such beams in non-axisymmetric lattice elements. The work supports commissioning activities at the FRIB Front End by illustrating how xy projections of the components of a multi-species beam become tilted due to dipoles and quadrupoles",
        "which can complicate charge state selection with slits. The results help guide simulations performed using the PIC code WARP to achieve better optimization of the collimation in the charge selection system (CSS). Beam statistical angular momentum also evolves in the CSS which in turn changes the x- and y-plane emittances. Possible implications of this effect on the final thermalized beam emittances delivered by the Front End are discussed."

The peak brightness of the ICS source can be maximized then if the electron phase space is transformed in a way so that all electrons scatter off the x-ray photons of same frequency in the same direction. We describe the x-ray photon beam quality through the Wigner function (6d photon phase space distribution) and derive it for the ICS source when the electron and laser rms matrices are arbitrary. We find the optimal uncorrelated electron beam phase space distribution resulting in the highest brightness of the ICS source for the simple on axis case as an example."

The program computes the deviation possibilities of synchrotron radiation rays emitted along bending magnet paths using discretized local phase space ellipses. The sizes of the ellipses are computed based on multi-bend achromat (MBA) lattice parameters and the limiting aperture size within the future storage ring vacuum system. For absorber height calculations",

The key performance requirement of the power supply includes a small-signal bandwidth of 10 kHz for the output current. This requirement presents a challenge to the design because of the high inductance of the magnet load and a limited input DC voltage. A prototype DC/DC power supply utilizing a MOSFET H-bridge circuit with a 500 kHz PWM has been developed and tested successfully. The prototype achieved a 10-kHz bandwidth with less than 3-dB attenuation for a signal 0.5% of the maximum operating current of 15 amperes. This paper presents the design of the power circuit",

In the course of the operation of these systems, there comes a time when vari-ous instruments have to be temporarily attached for diag-nostic purposes: RGAs, leak detectors, and additional pumps. In an effort to make the additions of these instru-ments easier and more time effective, we propose to use KF style flanges for these types of temporary diagnostic connections. This document will describe the tests used to compare the particles generated using the assembly of the, widely accepted for 'particle free' use, conflat flange to the proposed KF style flange, and demonstrate that KF flanges produce less particles. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The magnetron amplitude is modulated using a trim magnetic coil to alter the magnetic field in conjunction with the anode voltage to suppress the emittance growth due to microphonics and changing beam loads. The rate for microphonic noise can have frequencies in the range 10-50 Hz. This is competitive to the inductive decay time of the trim coil. Eddy currents will be induced in the copper anode of the magnetron that will buck the field from the trim coil in the interaction region. This paper will describe the magnetic circuit of the proposed magnetron as well as the calculation and handling of the Eddy currents on the magnetic field."

Optical misalignment and phase stability are two critical issues that need to be addressed. Herriott cells are implemented for their relaxed alignment tolerance and a phase stabilization method based on cavity output pattern matching has been developed. A single pulse with intensity enhancement factor over 7.4 has been generated by stacking 13 modulated pules through a four-cavity stacking system. This can be a possible path for generating TW KHz laser pulses for a future laser-driven plasma accelerator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The first set of FFOBLMs were installed outside the cryostat of the short SCU",

The next 1.1-m-long SCU is scheduled to replace the short SCU later in 2016 and will be fitted with FFOBLMs in a manner similar to original 1.1-m device. The FFOBLMs were employed to set timing and voltage for the abort kicker (AK) system. The AK helps to prevent quenching of the SCUs during beam dumps* by directing the beam away from the SC magnet windings. The AK is triggered by the Machine Protection System (MPS). In cases when the AK fails to prevent quenching",

The high intensity gamma-ray beam is produced using Compton scattering between the electron and FEL photon beams. The beam displacement and angle at the collision point need to be maintained constant during the gamma-ray beam production. The magnetic field of the copper bussbars carrying the current to the FEL wigglers can impact the beam orbit. The compensation scheme in-general is complicated. In this work",
        "we report preliminary results of a bussbar compensation scheme for one of the wiggler and power supply configurations. Significant reductions of the orbit distortions have been realized using this compensation."

      "abstract": "The figure-8 JLEIC collider ring opens wide possibilities for manipulating proton and deuteron spin directions during an experiment. Using 3D spin rotators, one can, at the same time, efficiently control the polarization direction as well as the spin tune value. The 3D spin rotators allow one to arrange a system for reversals of the spin direction in all beam bunches during an experiment, i.e. a spin-flipping system. To preserve the polarization, one has to satisfy the condition of adiabatic change of the spin direction. When adjusting the polarization direction, one can stabilize the spin tune value, which completely eliminates resonant beam depolarization during the spin manipulation process. We provide the results of numerical modeling of a spin-flipping system in the JLEIC ion collider ring. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of organizing a spin-flipping system using a 3D rota-tor. The figure-8 JLEIC collider provides a unique capability of doing high-precision experiments with polarized ion beams. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "The Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) is being designed to achieve a high luminosity of up to 1034 1/(cm2*sec). The latter requires a small beam size at the interaction point demanding a strong final focus (FF) quadrupole system. The strong beam focusing in the FF unavoidably creates a large chromaticity which has to be compensated in order to avoid a severe degradation of momentum acceptance. This has to be done while preserving sufficient dynamic aperture. An additional design requirement for the chromaticity compensation optics in the electron ring is preservation of the low beam emittance. This paper reviews the development and selection of a chromaticity correction scheme for the electron collider ring."

The electron accelerator of the eRHIC will be based on a 1.665 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) placed in the RHIC tunnel and two Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) recirculating rings placed alongside the RHIC accelerator. The electron bunches reach the 20 GeV energy after passing 12 times through the ERL by recirculation in the FFAG rings. The FFAG rings consist of FODO cells comprised of one focusing and one defocusing quadrupoles made of permanent magnet material. Similarly other sections of the electron accelerator will utilize permanent magnets. In this presentation we will discuss details on the design of these magnets and their advantages over the current-excited magnets. 1. <http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1409/1409.1633.pdf> reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The aim of the first experiments is to detect and study the self-modulation instability (SMI) of the long proton bunch ~12cm in a plasma with wakefields of period of ~1.2mm. The occurrence of SMI results in the formation of a charge core surrounded by a halo in the time-integrated images of the proton bunch transverse profile. Transverse profiles are obtained from scintillator screens and from optical transition radiation (OTR). The OTR is time resolved using a ps-resolution streak camera to determine the start of the wakefields along the bunch on a slow time scale (~ns)",
        "i.e.",
        "the location of the seeding of the SMI generated by the ionizing laser pulse. The modulation period is measured using the faster time scale (~ps). Coherent transition radiation (CTR) is analyzed by a heterodyne system to also yield the modulation frequency. Later experiments will sample the wakefields generated by externally injecting low-energy (~15MeV) electrons expected to be accelerated to the GeV energy level over the 10m-long plasma. Progress toward the completion of the experimental set-up will be presented."

Beams of different rare isotopes will be charge-bred by an EBIS charge breeder to a charge-to-mass ratio (q/A) ≥ 1/4 and accelerated by linac post-accelerator to energies of 18.5 MeV/u. RAON EBIS charge breeder will provide the next step in the development of breeder technology by implementation of electron beam with current up to 3 A and utilization of wide (8') warm bore of 6 T superconducting solenoid.

We investigate the scaling laws of the accelerating and focusing fields in the novel ''crunch-in'' regime [1] [2]. This regime is excited due to the collapse of the electron-rings from the channel walls onto the propagation axis of the energy-source in its wake. This regime is thus the non-linearly driven hollow channel",
        "since the electron-ring displacement is of the order of the channel radius [3]. We present the properties of the coherent structures in the ''crunch-in'' regime where the channel radius is matched to the beam properties such that channel-edge to on-axis collapse time has a direct correspondence to the energy source intensity. We also investigate the physical mechanisms that underlie the ''crunch-in'' wakefields by tuning the channel radius. Using a theoretical framework and results from PIC simulations the possible applications of the ''crunch-in'' regime for acceleration of positron beams with collider-scale parameters is presented.",

Slip stacking with 12 Booster batches per 1.33 sec cycle of the Main Injector has been implemented and extensive operation with 8 batches and 10 batches per MI cycle has been demonstrated. Operation in this mode since 2013 shows that loss localization is an essential component for long term operation. Beam loss in the Recycler will be localized in a collimation region with design capability for absorbing up to 2 kW of lost protons in a pair of 20-Ton collimators (absorbers). This system will employ a two stage collimation with a thin Mo scattering foil to define the bottom edge of both the injected and decelerated-for-slipping beams.

To restore it the nonlinear elements can be employed which move back tunes of large amplitude particles. In the present report we consider the possibility of creating a \"nonlinear integrable optics\" insertion in the Fermilab Recycler to host either octupoles or hollow electron lens for this purpose. For comparison we also consider the classic scheme with distributed octupole families. It is shown that for the Proton Improvement Plan II parameters the required nonlinear tuneshift can be created without destroying the dynamic aperture. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The 3rd harmonic cavity for the LCLS-II accelerator at SLAC will operate in a continuous wave (CW) regime. A CW operation and a high average current in the LCLS-II linac result in in-creased heat loads to main and HOM couplers of the cavity. Several cavity design modifications were pro-posed and investigated for improving a cavity perfor-mance in the CW regime. In this paper we present results of the design review for proposed modifications"

A method is offered based on Gaussian approximation of the original particle distribution in the phase space (Klimontovich distribution) which leads to an equation for the σ matrix which provides efficient suppression of the tails and cannot be obtained by introducing weights. This equation is easily solved by iterations in the multi-dimensional case.

To achieve the 700 MW beam power goals for the NOvA neutrino oscillation experiment, the Recycler accumulates 12 batches of 80-bunch trains from the Booster using slip-stacking. One set of bunch trains are injected into the ring and decelerated, then a second set is injected at the nominal momentum. The trains slip past each other longitudinally due to their momenta difference. We have recently extended the multi-bunch portion of the Synergia beam simulation program to allow co-propagation of bunch trains at different momenta. In doing so, we have expanded the applicability of the massively parallel multi-bunch physics portion of Synergia to include new categories of bunch-bunch interactions. We present results from our first application of these capabilities to batch-on-batch slip stacking in the Recycler.",

One promising application of integrable optics is to overcome the traditional limits on accelerator intensity imposed by betatron tune-spread and collective instabilities. The efficacy of high-intensity integrable accelerators will be undergo comprehensive testing over the next several years at the Fermilab Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). We propose an integrable RCS (iRCS) as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide a overview of the machine parameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization.

        "The Muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon to a precision of 140 ppb ─ a fourfold improvement over the 540 ppb precision obtained in BNL experiment E821. Obtaining this precision requires controlling total systematic errors at the 100 ppb level. One form of systematic error on the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment occurs when the muon beam injected and stored in the ring has a correlation between the muon's spin direction and its momentum. In this paper",
        "we first analyze the creation and transport of muon polarization from the production target to the Muon g-2 storage ring. Then",

High-flux and narrow-bandwidth LCS photon beam is realized in an energy recovery linac (ERL). An electron beam of high-average current and small-emittance collides with accumulating laser pulses in an enhancement cavity for generating high-flux LCS photon beam. We have developed the high-finesse bow-tie ring cavity for the LCS experiment at the Compact ERL (cERL) in KEK. In this presentation",

A key component of the project is the precision machining of the magnet structure and the precision of the coil winding.

The current design of the magnet structure is based on the assembled jaws with individual poles",
