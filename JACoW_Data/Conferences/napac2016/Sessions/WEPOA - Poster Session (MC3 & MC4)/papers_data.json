        "The AWAKE experimental program is scheduled to start at the end of 2016. The aim of the first experiments is to detect and study the self-modulation instability (SMI) of the long proton bunch ~12cm in a plasma with wakefields of period of ~1.2mm. The occurrence of SMI results in the formation of a charge core surrounded by a halo in the time-integrated images of the proton bunch transverse profile. Transverse profiles are obtained from scintillator screens and from optical transition radiation (OTR). The OTR is time resolved using a ps-resolution streak camera to determine the start of the wakefields along the bunch on a slow time scale (~ns)",
        "i.e.",
        "the location of the seeding of the SMI generated by the ionizing laser pulse. The modulation period is measured using the faster time scale (~ps). Coherent transition radiation (CTR) is analyzed by a heterodyne system to also yield the modulation frequency. Later experiments will sample the wakefields generated by externally injecting low-energy (~15MeV) electrons expected to be accelerated to the GeV energy level over the 10m-long plasma. Progress toward the completion of the experimental set-up will be presented."

Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) charge breeder will be used to prepare rare isotope ion beams produced by ISOL method for efficient acceleration. Beams of different rare isotopes will be charge-bred by an EBIS charge breeder to a charge-to-mass ratio (q/A) ≥ 1/4 and accelerated by linac post-accelerator to energies of 18.5 MeV/u. RAON EBIS charge breeder will provide the next step in the development of breeder technology by implementation of electron beam with current up to 3 A and utilization of wide (8') warm bore of 6 T superconducting solenoid. The design of RAON EBIS charge breeder and results of dumping of high power DC and pulsed electron beam into collector will be presented and discussed."

The evaluation of the radiation field around these beam elements gives a valuable piece of information to define the layout of the electronic devices to be installed in the surrounding tunnel area. Indeed the risk of SEE and long term damage has to be considered in order to max-imize the performance of the ESS accelerator and to avoid possible long down time.

        "Plasma wakefields driven inside a hollow-channel plasma are significantly different from those driven in a homogeneous plasma. We investigate the scaling laws of the accelerating and focusing fields in the novel ''crunch-in'' regime [1] [2]. This regime is excited due to the collapse of the electron-rings from the channel walls onto the propagation axis of the energy-source in its wake. This regime is thus the non-linearly driven hollow channel",
        "since the electron-ring displacement is of the order of the channel radius [3]. We present the properties of the coherent structures in the ''crunch-in'' regime where the channel radius is matched to the beam properties such that channel-edge to on-axis collapse time has a direct correspondence to the energy source intensity. We also investigate the physical mechanisms that underlie the ''crunch-in'' wakefields by tuning the channel radius. Using a theoretical framework and results from PIC simulations the possible applications of the ''crunch-in'' regime for acceleration of positron beams with collider-scale parameters is presented.",

Slip stacking with 12 Booster batches per 1.33 sec cycle of the Main Injector has been implemented and extensive operation with 8 batches and 10 batches per MI cycle has been demonstrated. Operation in this mode since 2013 shows that loss localization is an essential component for long term operation. Beam loss in the Recycler will be localized in a collimation region with design capability for absorbing up to 2 kW of lost protons in a pair of 20-Ton collimators (absorbers). This system will employ a two stage collimation with a thin Mo scattering foil to define the bottom edge of both the injected and decelerated-for-slipping beams.

To restore it the nonlinear elements can be employed which move back tunes of large amplitude particles. In the present report we consider the possibility of creating a \"nonlinear integrable optics\" insertion in the Fermilab Recycler to host either octupoles or hollow electron lens for this purpose. For comparison we also consider the classic scheme with distributed octupole families. It is shown that for the Proton Improvement Plan II parameters the required nonlinear tuneshift can be created without destroying the dynamic aperture. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
