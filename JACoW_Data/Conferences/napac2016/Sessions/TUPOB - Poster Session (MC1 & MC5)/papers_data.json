        "the 3-GeV pre-booster was converted into an 8-GeV booster of the same shape and size but using super-ferric magnets with fields up to 3 Tesla. In order to limit the foot-print of the JLEIC ion complex and reduce its total cost",
        "we have designed a more compact and cost-effective octagonal 3-GeV ring about half the size of the original one. At 3 GeV",
        "the figure-8 shape is not required to preserve ion polarization; Siberian snakes with reasonable magnetic fields can be used for spin correction. As the ion collider ring requires an injection energy of at least 8 GeV",
        "we propose to use the existing electron storage ring",
        "which is part of the electron complex",
        "as a large booster for the ions up to 11 GeV. The design optimization of the pre-booster ring will be presented leading to the final octagonal ring design. Preliminary beam simulations will also be presented and discussed."

The high intensity gamma-ray beam is produced using Compton scattering between the electron and FEL photon beams. The beam displacement and angle at the collision point need to be maintained constant during the gamma-ray beam production. The magnetic field of the copper bussbars carrying the current to the FEL wigglers can impact the beam orbit. The compensation scheme in-general is complicated. In this work",
        "we report preliminary results of a bussbar compensation scheme for one of the wiggler and power supply configurations. Significant reductions of the orbit distortions have been realized using this compensation."

Using 3D spin rotators, one can, at the same time, efficiently control the polarization direction as well as the spin tune value. The 3D spin rotators allow one to arrange a system for reversals of the spin direction in all beam bunches during an experiment, i.e. a spin-flipping system. To preserve the polarization, one has to satisfy the condition of adiabatic change of the spin direction. When adjusting the polarization direction, one can stabilize the spin tune value, which completely eliminates resonant beam depolarization during the spin manipulation process. We provide the results of numerical modeling of a spin-flipping system in the JLEIC ion collider ring. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of organizing a spin-flipping system using a 3D rota-tor.

The latter requires a small beam size at the interaction point demanding a strong final focus (FF) quadrupole system. The strong beam focusing in the FF unavoidably creates a large chromaticity which has to be compensated in order to avoid a severe degradation of momentum acceptance. This has to be done while preserving sufficient dynamic aperture. An additional design requirement for the chromaticity compensation optics in the electron ring is preservation of the low beam emittance. This paper reviews the development and selection of a chromaticity correction scheme for the electron collider ring."

The addition of skew quadrupoles to the PIC magnetic focusing channel induces coupled dynamic behavior of the beam that is radially periodic. The periodicity of the radial motion allows for the avoidance of unwanted resonances in the horizontal and vertical transverse planes",

This design of the double-ring collider also supports electron-ion collisions with similar electron-nucleon luminosities",
        "and is upgradeable to 1034 cm-2 sec-1 using bunched beam electron cooling of the hadron beam. The baseline luminosities are achievable using existing technologies and beam parameters that have been routinely achieved at RHIC in hadron-hadron collisions or elsewhere in e+e− collisions. This minimizes the risk associated with the challenging luminosity goal and is keeping the technical risk of the e-RHIC electron-ion collider low. The latest design status will be presented."

The electron accelerator of the eRHIC will be based on a 1.665 GeV Energy Recovery Linac (ERL) placed in the RHIC tunnel and two Fixed Field Alternating Gradient (FFAG) recirculating rings placed alongside the RHIC accelerator. The electron bunches reach the 20 GeV energy after passing 12 times through the ERL by recirculation in the FFAG rings. The FFAG rings consist of FODO cells comprised of one focusing and one defocusing quadrupoles made of permanent magnet material. Similarly other sections of the electron accelerator will utilize permanent magnets. In this presentation we will discuss details on the design of these magnets and their advantages over the current-excited magnets. 1. <http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1409/1409.1633.pdf> reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
