        "energy is conserved and so is the magnetic moment of the gyrating electron which is an adiabatic invariant. This leads to determination of a so called loss cone in velocity space. Using these principles we describe a method to estimate the probability distribution of trapping across the cross-section of a quadrupole for a given field gradient and electron energy. Such an estimate can serve as a precursor to more detailed numerical studies of electron cloud build and trapping in quadrupoles."

To achieve the 700 MW beam power goals for the NOvA neutrino oscillation experiment, the Recycler accumulates 12 batches of 80-bunch trains from the Booster using slip-stacking. One set of bunch trains are injected into the ring and decelerated, then a second set is injected at the nominal momentum. The trains slip past each other longitudinally due to their momenta difference. We have recently extended the multi-bunch portion of the Synergia beam simulation program to allow co-propagation of bunch trains at different momenta. In doing so, we have expanded the applicability of the massively parallel multi-bunch physics portion of Synergia to include new categories of bunch-bunch interactions. We present results from our first application of these capabilities to batch-on-batch slip stacking in the Recycler.",

One promising application of integrable optics is to overcome the traditional limits on accelerator intensity imposed by betatron tune-spread and collective instabilities. The efficacy of high-intensity integrable accelerators will be undergo comprehensive testing over the next several years at the Fermilab Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) and the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). We propose an integrable RCS (iRCS) as a replacement for the Fermilab Booster to achieve multi-MW beam power for the Fermilab high-energy neutrino program. We provide a overview of the machine parameters and discuss an approach to lattice optimization.

Multipacting affects superconducting RF cavities in the entire range from high energy elliptical cavities to coaxial resonators for low-beta part of the linac. The extensive simulations of multipacting in the cavities with updated material properties and comparison of the results with experimental data are routinely performed during electromagnetic design at Fermilab. This work is focused on multipacting study in the low-beta and high-beta 650 MHz elliptical cavities. The new advanced computing capabilities made it possible to take the space charge effect into account in this study. The results of the simulations and new features of multipacting due to the space charge effect are discussed."
