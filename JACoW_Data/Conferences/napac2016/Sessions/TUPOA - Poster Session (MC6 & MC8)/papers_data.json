        "THz frequency is a special electromagnetic wave which is categorized between a radio wave and a light wave. It can pass through the various materials like a radio wave and can be transported with optical components like a light wave. Thus",
        "it's suitable for imaging application of materials. At Waseda University",
        "it's possible to generate a high-quality electron beam using Cs-Te photocathode RF-Gun and the electron beam is applied to several application researches. As an application of this electron beam",
        "we generate a coherent Cherenkov radiation",
        "and succeed in observing a high power THz light. The successful results of high power THz radiation encourage us to perform the THz imaging with transmission and reflection imaging using some materials",
        "cross-section imaging using a simple material. On studying the THz imaging",
        "it is necessary to clarify the spatial resolution. So",
        "we tried to evaluate the spatial resolution in our device. Furthermore",
        "our target is to get the three-dimensional THz images. We will introduce the CT technique in order to obtain the clear cross-section image. In this conference",
        "we report the recent results of the THz imaging and future prospective."

The purpose is to make the control system more intelligent and automatically identify what and where problem when the alarm of the control system of the power supplies. That means that IoT can help to automatically identify which crate and which PSC board inserted in the crates and which PSI sittiing in the power supply crates as well as the optic fiber cables between the PSCs and the PSIs. It is great convenient for the maintainer to use a mobile phone to diagnose faults and create the electronic maintenance record."

During the acceleration the Radio Frequency (RF) cavities are swept from 38MHz to 52.8MHz and requires crossing through transition where accelerating phase is shifted 90 degrees. In order to keep the beam stable and minimize losses and emittance growth a longitudinal damping system is required. This has traditionally been done by dedicated analog electronics designed to operate on specific beam modes for frequencies of instabilities. A complete digital implementation has been developed for this same purpose. The new digital system features and performance are detailed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

The team has initially used a Hamamatsu C5680 synchroscan streak camera. An Al-coated Si screen was used to generate optical transition radiation (OTR) resulting from the beam's interaction with the screen. The chicane bypass beamline allowed the measurements of the bunch length without the compression stage at the downstream beamline location using OTR and the streak camera. The UV component of the drive laser had previously been characterized with a Gaussian fit σ of 3.5-3.7 ps**. However",

      "abstract": "Coherent Pulse Stacking provides a promising way to generate a single high-intensity laser pulse by stacking a sequence of phase and amplitude modulated laser pulses using multiple optical cavities. Optical misalignment and phase stability are two critical issues that need to be addressed. Herriott cells are implemented for their relaxed alignment tolerance and a phase stabilization method based on cavity output pattern matching has been developed. A single pulse with intensity enhancement factor over 7.4 has been generated by stacking 13 modulated pules through a four-cavity stacking system. This can be a possible path for generating TW KHz laser pulses for a future laser-driven plasma accelerator. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Some effort is needed to correct the parameters as a non-optimized pre-bunching setup can alter the beam phase space and the nominal beam intensity at a desired location. Here",

The first set of FFOBLMs were installed outside the cryostat of the short SCU",

The next 1.1-m-long SCU is scheduled to replace the short SCU later in 2016 and will be fitted with FFOBLMs in a manner similar to original 1.1-m device. The FFOBLMs were employed to set timing and voltage for the abort kicker (AK) system. The AK helps to prevent quenching of the SCUs during beam dumps* by directing the beam away from the SC magnet windings. The AK is triggered by the Machine Protection System (MPS). In cases when the AK fails to prevent quenching",
