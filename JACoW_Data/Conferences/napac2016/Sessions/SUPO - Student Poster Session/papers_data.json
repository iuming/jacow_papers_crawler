        "Oxygen plasmas have shown promise for removing surface hydrocarbons from niobium in superconducting RF cavities. These techniques are candidates for in-situ cleaning techniques for installed accelerating cavities. The goal is to improve the performance of cavities that have degraded over time",
        "without removing them from their cryomodule. By varying the governing parameters of the plasma",
        "the primary cleaning method can be varied between a primarily physical process (sputtering) and a primarily chemical process. We extend this work from organic contaminants to more general contaminants",

The FSSS method utilizes a single electron beam to generate a strong seed pulse and amplify it with a small energy spread electron slice. This extends the capability of self seeded XFELs by producing short pulses",
        "not limited by the duration set by the self-seeding monochromator system",
        "with high peak intensity. The scheme relies on using a parallel plate dechirper to impart a spatial chirp on the beam",
        "and appropriate orbit control to lase with different electron beam slices before and after the self-seeding monochromator. The performance of the FSSS method is analyzed with start-to-end simulations for the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). The simulations include the effect of the parallel plate dechirper and propagation of the radiation field through the monochromator. We also present results of the first successful demonstration of FSSS at LCLS. The radiation properties of FSSS X-ray pulses are compared with the Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) mode of FEL operation for the same electron beam parameters."

The work supports commissioning activities at the FRIB Front End by illustrating how xy projections of the components of a multi-species beam become tilted due to dipoles and quadrupoles",

The results help guide simulations performed using the PIC code WARP to achieve better optimization of the collimation in the charge selection system (CSS). Beam statistical angular momentum also evolves in the CSS which in turn changes the x- and y-plane emittances. Possible implications of this effect on the final thermalized beam emittances delivered by the Front End are discussed."

The brightness of these sources is limited by the electron beam quality since electrons traveling at different angles",
        "and/or having different energies",
        "produce photons with different energies. Therefore",
        "the spectral brightness of the source is defined by the 6d electron phase space shape and size",
        "as well as laser beam parameters. The peak brightness of the ICS source can be maximized then if the electron phase space is transformed in a way so that all electrons scatter off the x-ray photons of same frequency in the same direction. We describe the x-ray photon beam quality through the Wigner function (6d photon phase space distribution) and derive it for the ICS source when the electron and laser rms matrices are arbitrary. We find the optimal uncorrelated electron beam phase space distribution resulting in the highest brightness of the ICS source for the simple on axis case as an example."
