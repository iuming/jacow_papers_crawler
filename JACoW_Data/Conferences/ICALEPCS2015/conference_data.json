The goodness-of-fit of the model is assessed by field testing and comprehensive residual analysis. Finally a new model is suggested for the magnets to be implemented for more accurate results."

The unique location of the XTCAV in the beamline posed several challenges. A new design of the Modulator and Klystron control Support Unit (MKSU-II) for interlocking was added at the XTCAV controls station that required new software development. The timing setup was also different from the rest of the Linac. This paper outlines the LLRF controls layout for the XTCAV and discusses the manner in which the challenges were addressed.

At the light source BESSY II these are the transversal tunes as well as the path length and energy. These compensations are realized using feedback control loops together with supervising state machines. Key to the tune control is a multi-source tune determination algorithm. For the path length correction empirical findings are utilized. All involved software systems and data-paths are sketched.",

            "The measured bending field of the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS) is received in real-time by the longitudinal beam control system and converted into the revolution frequency used as set-point for beam phase and radial loops. With the renovation of the bending field measurement system the transmission technique is changed from a differential sequence of pulses, the so-called B-train, to a stream of Ethernet frames based on the White Rabbit protocol. The packets contain field, its derivative and auxiliary information. A new frequency program for the conversion of the bending field into the revolution frequency, depending also on parameters like radius of the accelerator and the particle type, has been developed. Instead of storing large conversion tables from field to frequency for fixed parameters, the frequencies are directly calculated in programmable logic (FPGA). In order to reduce development time and keep flexibility, the conversion is processed in real-time in the FPGA using Xilinx floating-point primitives mapped by a higher level tool Simulink System Generator. Commissioning with beam of the new frequency program in the PS is progressing."

The reliability of the BPS thus directly impacts RHIC availability. An analytical multistate reliability model of the BPS has been developed to understand the failure development and propagation over store length variation. BPS has a modular structure. The individual modules have joint survival distributions defined by competing risks with exponential lifetimes. Modules differ in functionality and input response. The overall complex behavior of the system is analyzed by first principles for different failure/success states of the system. The model structure changes according to the type of scenario. The analytical model yields the marginal survival distribution for each scenario versus different store lengths. Analysis of structural importance and interdependencies of modules is also examined. A former Monte Carlo model* is used for the verification of the analytical model for a certain store length. This work is next step towards building knowledge base for eRHIC design by understanding finer failure characteristics of the BPS.",

For SuperKEKB, the new abort trigger system was developed. It collects more than 130 beam abort request signals and issues the beam abort trigger signal to the abort kickers. The request signals are partially aggregated in local control rooms located along the SuperKEKB ring and finally aggregated in central control room. In order to increase the system reliability, the VME-based module and the O/E module was developed, and all the abort signals between the modules are transmitted as optical signals. The VME-based module aggregates input signals and input signals are OR and latched. The E/O module converts electrical signal from abort request source to optical signal. The system also has the timestamp function to keep track of the abort signal received time. The timestamps are expected to contribute to identify the cause of the beam abort. Based on feasibility tests with a prototype module, the new module design was improved and fixed. This paper describes the details of the new abort trigger system."

The EPICS data archive systems are necessary to be built to record various machine parameters and status information into the RDB for long time logging. The specific applications have been developed to analyze the archived data which retrieved from the RDB. One EPICS alarm system is necessary to be set up to monitor sub-system status and record detail information into the RDB if the problem happened. Some Web-based applications with RDB have been gradually created to show the TPS machine status related information. The efforts are described at this paper."

This transition changed the priorities within the observatory, in which, most of the available time will be dedicated to science observations at the expense of technical time that software testing used to have available in abundance. The scarcity of the technical time surfaces one of the weakest points in the existent infrastructure available for software testing: the simulation environment of the ALMA software. The existent simulation focuses on the functionality aspect but not on the real operation scenarios with all the antennas. Therefore, scalability and performance problems introduced by new features or hidden in the current accepted software cannot be verified until the actual problem explodes during operation. Therefore, it was planned to design and implement a new simulation environment, which must be comparable, or at least, be representative of the production environment. In this paper we will review experiences gained and lessons learnt during the design and implementation of the new simulated environment.",

In this talk",

Combining the network traffic analysis with the use of large graph visualization algorithms we produce comprehensible and usable 2D large colour topology graphs mapping the complex network relations of the control system machines and services in a detail and clarity never seen before.

            "Store. Synchrotron is a service for management and publication of diffraction data from the macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines of the Australian Synchrotron. Since the start of the development, in 2013, the service has handled over 51.8 TB of raw data (~ 4.1 million files). Raw data and autoprocessing results are made available securely via the web and SFTP so experimenters can sync it to their labs for further analysis. With the goal of becoming a large public repository of raw diffraction data, a guided publishing workflow which optionally captures discipline specific information was built. The MX-specific workflow links PDB coordinates from the PDB to raw data. An optionally embargoed DOI is created for convenient citation. This repository will be a valuable tool for crystallography software developers. To support complex projects, integration of other instruments such as microscopes is underway. We developed an application that captures any data from instrument computers, enabling centralised data management without the need for custom ingestion workflows. The next step is to integrate the hosted data with interactive processing and analysis tools on virtual desktops."

The incident neutrons are captured by the 3He producing a tritium and an hydrogen which are sharing the 765 keV of energy generated in the reaction. The classical geometry of a charge-division neutron detector consists of a cylindrical volume housing a resistive anode. Electrical signals are extracted at both ends of the tube and the information about the interaction point along the tube can be derived from the ratio of the collected charged at both ends. The classical analog approach for the charge readout consists of a shaping amplifier coupled with a peak sensing ADC. The development of a new digital front-end electronics based on 64 channels",

Many data cleaning techniques are employed to reduce the noise in the observed data. Piecewise regression has been used to examine the saturation effects in magnet inductance. The goodness-of-fit of the model is assessed by field testing and comprehensive residual analysis. Finally a new model is suggested for the magnets to be implemented for more accurate results."

The unique location of the XTCAV in the beamline posed several challenges. A new design of the Modulator and Klystron control Support Unit (MKSU-II) for interlocking was added at the XTCAV controls station that required new software development. The timing setup was also different from the rest of the Linac. This paper outlines the LLRF controls layout for the XTCAV and discusses the manner in which the challenges were addressed. XTCAV has now become a successful tool for gathering data that enables reconstruction of X-ray FEL power profiles with greater resolution.",

The previous process proved insufficient in the fall of 2011 when a fire broke out in a septa magnet along the beam line due to a lack of communication about the status of systems. The improved process provides rigorous verification of system readiness thus protecting property while minimizing program delays. To achieve these goals",
        "a database and web application were created to maintain an accurate list of machine components and coordinate and record verification checks by each responsible group. The process requires groups to publish checklists detailing each system check to encourage good work practice. Within groups",

For a larger vibration such as earthquakes are also deleterious to beam stability or even make the beam trip due to the quench of superconducting RF cavity. A data acquisition system integrated with an earthquake detector is also quite necessary to show and archive the data on the control system.

With the renovation of the bending field measurement system the transmission technique is changed from a differential sequence of pulses, the so-called B-train, to a stream of Ethernet frames based on the White Rabbit protocol. The packets contain field, its derivative and auxiliary information. A new frequency program for the conversion of the bending field into the revolution frequency, depending also on parameters like radius of the accelerator and the particle type, has been developed. Instead of storing large conversion tables from field to frequency for fixed parameters, the frequencies are directly calculated in programmable logic (FPGA). In order to reduce development time and keep flexibility, the conversion is processed in real-time in the FPGA using Xilinx floating-point primitives mapped by a higher level tool Simulink System Generator. Commissioning with beam of the new frequency program in the PS is progressing."

      "abstract": "The RHIC Beam Permit System (BPS) monitors the anomalies occurring in the collider and restores the machine to a safe state upon fault detection. The reliability of the BPS thus directly impacts RHIC availability. An analytical multistate reliability model of the BPS has been developed to understand the failure development and propagation over store length variation. BPS has a modular structure. The individual modules have joint survival distributions defined by competing risks with exponential lifetimes. Modules differ in functionality and input response. The overall complex behavior of the system is analyzed by first principles for different failure/success states of the system. The model structure changes according to the type of scenario. The analytical model yields the marginal survival distribution for each scenario versus different store lengths. Analysis of structural importance and interdependencies of modules is also examined. A former Monte Carlo model* is used for the verification of the analytical model for a certain store length. This work is next step towards building knowledge base for eRHIC design by understanding finer failure characteristics of the BPS.",

For SuperKEKB, the new abort trigger system was developed. It collects more than 130 beam abort request signals and issues the beam abort trigger signal to the abort kickers. The request signals are partially aggregated in local control rooms located along the SuperKEKB ring and finally aggregated in central control room. In order to increase the system reliability, the VME-based module and the O/E module was developed, and all the abort signals between the modules are transmitted as optical signals. The VME-based module aggregates input signals and input signals are OR and latched. The E/O module converts electrical signal from abort request source to optical signal. The system also has the timestamp function to keep track of the abort signal received time. The timestamps are expected to contribute to identify the cause of the beam abort. Based on feasibility tests with a prototype module, the new module design was improved and fixed. This paper describes the details of the new abort trigger system."

In 2011, we started an ambitious project to refurbish key elements of the LANSCE accelerator that have become obsolete or were near end-of-life. The control system went through an upgrade process that affected different areas of LANSCE. Many improvements have been made but funding challenges and LANSCE operational commitments have delayed project deliverables. In this paper, we will discuss our upgrade choices, what we have accomplished so far, what we have learned about upgrading the existing control system and what challenges we still face."

The relational database (RDB) has been set up for some of the TPS control system applications used. The EPICS data archive systems are necessary to be built to record various machine parameters and status information into the RDB for long time logging. The specific applications have been developed to analyze the archived data which retrieved from the RDB. One EPICS alarm system is necessary to be set up to monitor sub-system status and record detail information into the RDB if the problem happened. Some Web-based applications with RDB have been gradually created to show the TPS machine status related information. The efforts are described at this paper."

This transition changed the priorities within the observatory, in which, most of the available time will be dedicated to science observations at the expense of technical time that software testing used to have available in abundance. The scarcity of the technical time surfaces one of the weakest points in the existent infrastructure available for software testing: the simulation environment of the ALMA software. The existent simulation focuses on the functionality aspect but not on the real operation scenarios with all the antennas. Therefore, scalability and performance problems introduced by new features or hidden in the current accepted software cannot be verified until the actual problem explodes during operation. Therefore, it was planned to design and implement a new simulation environment, which must be comparable, or at least, be representative of the production environment. In this paper we will review experiences gained and lessons learnt during the design and implementation of the new simulated environment.",

        "Store. Synchrotron is a service for management and publication of diffraction data from the macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines of the Australian Synchrotron. Since the start of the development, in 2013, the service has handled over 51.8 TB of raw data (~ 4.1 million files). Raw data and autoprocessing results are made available securely via the web and SFTP so experimenters can sync it to their labs for further analysis. With the goal of becoming a large public repository of raw diffraction data, a guided publishing workflow which optionally captures discipline specific information was built. The MX-specific workflow links PDB coordinates from the PDB to raw data. An optionally embargoed DOI is created for convenient citation. This repository will be a valuable tool for crystallography software developers. To support complex projects, integration of other instruments such as microscopes is underway. We developed an application that captures any data from instrument computers, enabling centralised data management without the need for custom ingestion workflows. The next step is to integrate the hosted data with interactive processing and analysis tools on virtual desktops."

        "3He gas-filled detectors are a classical choice for the detection of thermal and cold neutrons. The incident neutrons are captured by the 3He producing a tritium and an hydrogen which are sharing the 765 keV of energy generated in the reaction. The classical geometry of a charge-division neutron detector consists of a cylindrical volume housing a resistive anode. Electrical signals are extracted at both ends of the tube and the information about the interaction point along the tube can be derived from the ratio of the collected charged at both ends. The classical analog approach for the charge readout consists of a shaping amplifier coupled with a peak sensing ADC. The development of a new digital front-end electronics based on 64 channels",

RAON accelerator consists of a number of facilities and equipments as a large-scaled experimental device operating under the distributed environment. For synchronization control between these experimental devices, timing system of the RAON uses the VME-based EVG/EVR system. In order to test the high-speed performance of the control logic with the minimized event signal delay, it is planned to establish the step motor controller testbed applying the FPGA chip. The testbed controller will be configured with Zynq 7000 series of Xilinx FPGA chip. Zynq as SoC (System on Chip) is divided into PS (Processing System) with PL (Programmable Logic). PS with the dual-core ARM cpu is performing the high-level control logic at run-time on linux operating system. PL with the low-level FPGA I/O signal interfaces with the step motor controller with the event signal received from timing system. This paper describes the content and performance evaluation obtained from the step motor control through the various synchronized event signal received from the timing system.",

Security is established by restricting access to users within the local network while not limiting this access strictly to Linux consoles. Additionally",

This will allow as simple as possible a transition to be made to using CS-Studio as Diamond's user interface to EPICS. It further opens up the possibility of integrating the control system user interface with those in the Eclipse based GDA and DAWN tools which are used for data acquisition and data analysis at Diamond."

Running the IOC on a powerful machine rather than on a small dedicated computer has a number of advantages such as fast code execution and the availability of a large amount of memory. A large EPICS database can be loaded into the IOC and used for visualization of the interlocks implemented in the PLC. The information about interlock status registers",
