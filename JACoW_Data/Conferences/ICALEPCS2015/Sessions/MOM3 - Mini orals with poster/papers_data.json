The rate monitor of second particles from the target was prepared to detect short pulse injection.

The beam loss monitor was upgraded to read out always to detect unexpected high intensity beam promptly. These signals were included in the interlock system. In this paper",

This work is targeted towards remodeling the magnets through nonlinear system identification for the improvement in QDS reliability. The nonlinear electrical behavior of the SC magnets is investigated by statistical data analysis of magnet current and voltage signals. Many data cleaning techniques are employed to reduce the noise in the observed data. Piecewise regression has been used to examine the saturation effects in magnet inductance. The goodness-of-fit of the model is assessed by field testing and comprehensive residual analysis. Finally a new model is suggested for the magnets to be implemented for more accurate results."
