        "SLAC's Low Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) controls software for the S-Band deflecting structures needed to be upgraded significantly when a new X-Band transverse deflecting cavity (XTCAV) was installed downstream of the LCLS undulators in Spring 2013 to assist in FEL diagnostics such as characterizing the temporal profile of X-ray pulses that vary shot-to-shot. The unique location of the XTCAV in the beamline posed several challenges. A new design of the Modulator and Klystron control Support Unit (MKSU-II) for interlocking was added at the XTCAV controls station that required new software development. The timing setup was also different from the rest of the Linac. This paper outlines the LLRF controls layout for the XTCAV and discusses the manner in which the challenges were addressed. XTCAV has now become a successful tool for gathering data that enables reconstruction of X-ray FEL power profiles with greater resolution.",

The previous process proved insufficient in the fall of 2011 when a fire broke out in a septa magnet along the beam line due to a lack of communication about the status of systems. The improved process provides rigorous verification of system readiness thus protecting property while minimizing program delays. To achieve these goals",
        "a database and web application were created to maintain an accurate list of machine components and coordinate and record verification checks by each responsible group. The process requires groups to publish checklists detailing each system check to encourage good work practice. Within groups",

For a larger vibration such as earthquakes are also deleterious to beam stability or even make the beam trip due to the quench of superconducting RF cavity. A data acquisition system integrated with an earthquake detector is also quite necessary to show and archive the data on the control system. The data acquisition systems of vibration and earthquake measurement system are summarized in this report. The relationship between the beam motion and magnets vibration will also study here."

With the renovation of the bending field measurement system the transmission technique is changed from a differential sequence of pulses, the so-called B-train, to a stream of Ethernet frames based on the White Rabbit protocol. The packets contain field, its derivative and auxiliary information. A new frequency program for the conversion of the bending field into the revolution frequency, depending also on parameters like radius of the accelerator and the particle type, has been developed. Instead of storing large conversion tables from field to frequency for fixed parameters, the frequencies are directly calculated in programmable logic (FPGA). In order to reduce development time and keep flexibility, the conversion is processed in real-time in the FPGA using Xilinx floating-point primitives mapped by a higher level tool Simulink System Generator. Commissioning with beam of the new frequency program in the PS is progressing."

The reliability of the BPS thus directly impacts RHIC availability. An analytical multistate reliability model of the BPS has been developed to understand the failure development and propagation over store length variation. BPS has a modular structure. The individual modules have joint survival distributions defined by competing risks with exponential lifetimes. Modules differ in functionality and input response. The overall complex behavior of the system is analyzed by first principles for different failure/success states of the system. The model structure changes according to the type of scenario. The analytical model yields the marginal survival distribution for each scenario versus different store lengths. Analysis of structural importance and interdependencies of modules is also examined. A former Monte Carlo model* is used for the verification of the analytical model for a certain store length. This work is next step towards building knowledge base for eRHIC design by understanding finer failure characteristics of the BPS.",

For SuperKEKB, the new abort trigger system was developed. It collects more than 130 beam abort request signals and issues the beam abort trigger signal to the abort kickers. The request signals are partially aggregated in local control rooms located along the SuperKEKB ring and finally aggregated in central control room. In order to increase the system reliability, the VME-based module and the O/E module was developed, and all the abort signals between the modules are transmitted as optical signals. The VME-based module aggregates input signals and input signals are OR and latched. The E/O module converts electrical signal from abort request source to optical signal. The system also has the timestamp function to keep track of the abort signal received time. The timestamps are expected to contribute to identify the cause of the beam abort. Based on feasibility tests with a prototype module, the new module design was improved and fixed. This paper describes the details of the new abort trigger system."

In 2011, we started an ambitious project to refurbish key elements of the LANSCE accelerator that have become obsolete or were near end-of-life. The control system went through an upgrade process that affected different areas of LANSCE. Many improvements have been made but funding challenges and LANSCE operational commitments have delayed project deliverables. In this paper, we will discuss our upgrade choices, what we have accomplished so far, what we have learned about upgrading the existing control system and what challenges we still face."

        "actuator scaling errors and drifts in tune are considered as the main sources of spatial uncertainties and because most electron orbit feedback systems use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to decouple the inputs and outputs of the system",
        "the uncertainty can be expressed in terms of this decomposition. However SVD does not allow the main sources of uncertainty to be decoupled so instead",
        "a Fourier-based decomposition of the response matrix is used to decouple and model the uncertainties. In this paper",
        "both Fourier and SVD uncertainty modelling methods are applied to the Diamond Light Source storage ring and compared."
