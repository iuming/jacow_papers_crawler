The protocol provides acknowledged reception based on a sliding window concept. The implementation provides for up to 10 Mbyte messages and guarrantees complete delivery or a corresponding error. The protocol is implemented as a standalone messaging between two sockets and also within the context of Fermilab's ACNet protocol. Results of this implementation in vxWorks is analyzed.",

This was achieved through the consistent improvement of the control software and the provision of a 24-hour expert on-call service. One remaining potential cause of significant downtime was the failure of the computers hosting the DCS software. To minimize the impact of these failures after the restart of the LHC in 2015",

The relational database (RDB) has been set up for some of the TPS control system applications used. The EPICS data archive systems are necessary to be built to record various machine parameters and status information into the RDB for long time logging. The specific applications have been developed to analyze the archived data which retrieved from the RDB. One EPICS alarm system is necessary to be set up to monitor sub-system status and record detail information into the RDB if the problem happened. Some Web-based applications with RDB have been gradually created to show the TPS machine status related information. The efforts are described at this paper."

      "abstract": "The Atacama Large Millimeter /sub millimeter Array (ALMA) has entered into operation phase since 2014. This transition changed the priorities within the observatory, in which, most of the available time will be dedicated to science observations at the expense of technical time that software testing used to have available in abundance. The scarcity of the technical time surfaces one of the weakest points in the existent infrastructure available for software testing: the simulation environment of the ALMA software. The existent simulation focuses on the functionality aspect but not on the real operation scenarios with all the antennas. Therefore, scalability and performance problems introduced by new features or hidden in the current accepted software cannot be verified until the actual problem explodes during operation. Therefore, it was planned to design and implement a new simulation environment, which must be comparable, or at least, be representative of the production environment. In this paper we will review experiences gained and lessons learnt during the design and implementation of the new simulated environment.",

        "Store. Synchrotron is a service for management and publication of diffraction data from the macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines of the Australian Synchrotron. Since the start of the development, in 2013, the service has handled over 51.8 TB of raw data (~ 4.1 million files). Raw data and autoprocessing results are made available securely via the web and SFTP so experimenters can sync it to their labs for further analysis. With the goal of becoming a large public repository of raw diffraction data, a guided publishing workflow which optionally captures discipline specific information was built. The MX-specific workflow links PDB coordinates from the PDB to raw data. An optionally embargoed DOI is created for convenient citation. This repository will be a valuable tool for crystallography software developers. To support complex projects, integration of other instruments such as microscopes is underway. We developed an application that captures any data from instrument computers, enabling centralised data management without the need for custom ingestion workflows. The next step is to integrate the hosted data with interactive processing and analysis tools on virtual desktops."

        "The radiofrequency and transverse damper feedback systems of the Large Hadron Collider digitize beam phase and position measurements at the bunch repetition rate of 40 MHz. Embedded memory buffers allow a few milliseconds of full rate bunch-by-bunch data to be retrieved over the VME bus for diagnostic purposes",
        "but experience during LHC Run I has shown that for beam studies much longer data records are desirable. A new \"observation box\" diagnostic system is being developed which parasitically captures data streamed directly out of the feedback hardware into a Linux server through an optical fiber link",
        "and permits processing and buffering of full rate data for around one minute. The system will be connected to an LHC-wide trigger network for detection of beam instabilities",
        "which allows efficient capture of signals from the onset of beam instability events. The data will be made available for analysis by client applications through interfaces which are exposed as standard equipment devices within CERN's controls framework. It is also foreseen to perform online Fourier analysis of transverse position data inside the observation box using GPUs with the aim of extracting betatron tune signals."

The classical geometry of a charge-division neutron detector consists of a cylindrical volume housing a resistive anode. Electrical signals are extracted at both ends of the tube and the information about the interaction point along the tube can be derived from the ratio of the collected charged at both ends. The classical analog approach for the charge readout consists of a shaping amplifier coupled with a peak sensing ADC. The development of a new digital front-end electronics based on 64 channels",

In order to test the high-speed performance of the control logic with the minimized event signal delay, it is planned to establish the step motor controller testbed applying the FPGA chip. The testbed controller will be configured with Zynq 7000 series of Xilinx FPGA chip. Zynq as SoC (System on Chip) is divided into PS (Processing System) with PL (Programmable Logic). PS with the dual-core ARM cpu is performing the high-level control logic at run-time on linux operating system. PL with the low-level FPGA I/O signal interfaces with the step motor controller with the event signal received from timing system. This paper describes the content and performance evaluation obtained from the step motor control through the various synchronized event signal received from the timing system.",

This will allow as simple as possible a transition to be made to using CS-Studio as Diamond's user interface to EPICS.
