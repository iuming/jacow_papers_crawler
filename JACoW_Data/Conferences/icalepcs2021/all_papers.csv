icalepcs2021,,MOKL01,Highlights of Accelerator R&D at Shanghai Light Sources Cluster,SSRF; Shanghai; People’s Republic of China; In order to establish a world-class photonic science research center; several large-scale facilities including synchrotron radiation light source and free electron lasers had been scheduled at SARI. SSRF had been completed at the end of 2010 and currently in operation as the only third-generation synchrotron radiation source in China. SXFEL-TF has completed and demonstrated EEHG-HGHG mode at the end of 2020. This facility will be upgraded to a EXFEL-UF in 2021. The SHINE project started Infrastructure construction and key instruments development from 2018. Currently the injector tunnel is ready for accelerator installation and commissioning. To ensure the smooth construction of the aforementioned accelerator facilities; the accelerator team has carried out research on a number of key technologies: including superconducting acceleration modules; room temperature high-gradient acceleration technology; advanced undulator technology; and digital beam diagnostics and control technology. This article will briefly introduce the construction and operation of the above-mentioned large scientific facilities; as well as the latest progress of key technology development.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mokl01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mokl01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mokl01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOKL01,

In the past two years the project organisation has been focused on phase II of the MAX IV Laboratory development; aiming to raise the number of beamlines in operation to 16. The KITS group; responsible for the control and computing systems of the entire laboratory; was a major actor in the realisation of this phase as well as in the continuous up-keep of the user operation. The challenge consisted principally of establishing a clear project management plan for the support groups; including KITS; to handle this high load in an efficient and focused way; meanwhile gaining the experience of operating a 4th generation light source. The momentum gained was impacted by the last extensive shutdown due to the pandemic and shifted toward the remote user experiment; taking advantage of web technologies. This article focuses on how KITS has handled this growing phase in term of technology and organisation; to finally describe the new perspective for the MAX IV Laboratory; which will face a bright future.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/moal01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/moal01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/moal01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOAL01,1

Each laser shot delivers up to 1.9 MJ of ultraviolet light; driving target temperatures to in excess of 180 million K and pressures 100 billion times atmospheric ’ making possible direct study of conditions mimicking interiors of stars and planets; as well as our primary scientific applications: stockpile stewardship and fusion power. NIF control and diagnostic systems allow physicists to precisely manipulate; measure and image this extremely dense and hot matter. A major focus in the past two years has been adding comprehensive new diagnostic instruments to evaluate increasing energy and power of the laser drive. When COVID-19 struck; the controls team leveraged remote access technology to provide efficient operational support without stress of on-site presence. NIF continued to mitigate inevitable technology obsolescence after 20 years since construction. In this talk; we will discuss successes and challenges; including NIF progress towards ignition; achieving record neutron yields in early 2021.,Funding: This work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/moal02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/moal02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/moal02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOAL02,9

An upgrade to double the machine power from 1.4 MW to 2.8 MW is currently underway and a project to add a second target station is in the preliminary design phase. While each project will add the controls needed for their specific scope, the existing control system hardware, software, and infrastructure require upgrades to maintain high availability and ensure the system will meet facility requirements into the future. While some systems have received new hardware due to obsolescence, much of the system is original apart from some maintenance and technology refresh. Software will also become obsolete and must be upgraded for sustainability. Further, requirements for system capacity can be expected to increase as more subsystems upgrade to smarter devices capable of higher data rates. This paper covers planned improvements to the integrated control system with a focus on reliability, sustainability, and future capability.",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/moar01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/moar01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/moar01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOAR01,21

Following that work; a technology refresh of NIF’s Digital Video (DVID) systems was identified as the next important step. The DVIDs were facing long-term maintenance risk due to its obsolete Window XP platform; with over 500 computers to be individually upgraded and patched; 24 camera types with a variety of I/O interfaces and proprietary drivers/software with their licensing needs. In this presentation; we discuss how we leveraged the strengths of NIF’s distributed; cross platform architecture and our system migration expertise to migrate the DVID platforms to diskless clients booting off a single purpose-built immutable Linux image; and replacing proprietary camera drivers with open-source drivers. The in-place upgrades with well-defined fallback strategies ensured minimal impact to the continuous 24/7 shot operations. We will also present our strategy for continuous build; test; and release of the Linux OS image to keep up with future security patches and package upgrades.,Funding: This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.,LLNL IM Document Release Number: LLNL-ABS-822092,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/moar02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/moar02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/moar02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOAR02,26

The design is based on a five-mirror scheme; incorporating Adaptive Optics (AO). The primary mirror consists of 798 segments with 1.4m diameter. The main control challenges can be identified in the number of sensors (~25000) and actuators (~15000) to be coordinated; the computing performance and small latency required for phasing of the primary mirror and the AO. We focus on the design and implementation of the supervisory systems and control strategies. This includes a real time computing (RTC) toolkit to support the implementation of the AO for telescope and instruments. We will also report on the progress done in the implementation of the control software infrastructure necessary for development; testing and integration.

The RTF dynamically constructs applications at runtime from the configuration. The principal building blocks that compose an application process are called Function Blocks (FB); which follow a modular structure pattern. The application configuration defines the information that can influence control behavior; such as the connections among FBs; their corresponding parameters; and event handlers. The consecutive pipeline process in a busy-waiting mode and a data-driven pattern minimizes jitter and hardens the deterministic system behavior. In contrast; infrastructural capabilities are managed differently in the service layer using non-real-time threads. The deployment configuration covers the final placement of a program instance and thread allocation to the appropriate computing infrastructure. In this paper; we will introduce the architecture and design patterns of the framework as well as the real-life examples used to benchmark the RTF.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mobl02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mobl02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mobl02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOBL02,45
icalepcs2021,,MOBL03,Machine Learning Platform: Deploying and Managing Models in the CERN Control System,J.-B. de Martel; R. Gorbonosov; N. Madysa; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Recent advances make machine learning (ML) a powerful tool to cope with the inherent complexity of accelerators; the large number of degrees of freedom and continuously drifting machine characteristics. A diverse set of ML ecosystems; frameworks and tools are already being used at CERN for a variety of use cases such as optimization; anomaly detection and forecasting. We have adopted a unified approach to model storage; versioning and deployment which accommodates this diversity; and we apply software engineering best practices to achieve the reproducibility needed in the mission-critical context of particle accelerator controls. This paper describes CERN Machine Learning Platform - our central platform for storing; versioning and deploying ML models in the CERN Control Center. We present a unified solution which allows users to create; update and deploy models with minimal effort; without constraining their workflow or restricting their choice of tools. It also provides tooling to automate seamless model updates as the machine characteristics evolve. Moreover; the system allows model developers to focus on domain-specific development by abstracting infrastructural concerns.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mobl03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mobl03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mobl03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOBL03,50

Monitoring and incident analysis requires quick access to historic values of control data. While Karabo’s original custom-built text-file-based data logging system suits well for small systems; a time series data base offers in general a faster data access; as well as advanced data filtering; aggregation and reduction options. EuXFEL has chosen InfluxDB** as backend that is operated since summer 2020. Historic data can be displayed as before via the Karabo GUI or now also via the powerful Grafana*** web interface. The latter is e.g. used heavily in the new Data Operation Center of the EuXFEL.

icalepcs2021,,MOBL05,Photon Science Controls: A Flexible and Distributed LabVIEW Framework for Laser Systems,B.A. Davis; B.T. Fishler; R.J. McDonald; LLNL; Livermore; California; USA; LabVIEW software is often chosen for developing small scale control systems; especially for novice software developers. However; because of its ease of use; many functional LabVIEW applications suffer from limits to extensibility and scalability. Developing highly extensible and scalable applications requires significant skill and time investment. To close this gap between new and experienced developers we present an object-oriented application framework that offloads complex architecture tasks from the developer. The framework provides native functionality for data acquisition; logging; and publishing over HTTP and WebSocket with extensibility for adding further capabilities. The system is scalable and supports both single process applications and small to medium sized distributed systems. By leveraging the framework; developers can produce robust applications that are easily integrated into a unified architecture for simple and distributed systems. This allows for decreased system development time; improved onboarding for new developers; and simple framework extension for new capabilities.,Funding: This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mobl05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mobl05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mobl05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOBL05,62

A TCP/IP protocol based C networking library; ROMULUSlib; was developed that forms the interface between CROME and the SCADA supervision software through the ROMULUS protocol. ROMULUSlib encapsulates Real-Time and Historical data; parameters and acknowledgement data in TCP/IP frames that offers high reliability and flexibility; full-duplex communication with the CROME devices and supports multi-architecture development by utilization of the POSIX standard. ROMULUSlib is autonomous as it works as a standalone library that can support integration with supervision applications by addition or modification of parameters of the data frame.

Its design comprises close to 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes deployed at a southern (Paranal; Chile) and a northern (La Palma; Canary Islands; Spain) site. The inclusion of various array elements; like Large-Sized; Medium-Sized and Small-Sized Telescopes; instruments for atmosphere monitoring; etc; into the Array Control and Data Acquisition System (ACADA) poses a particular challenge which is met by an appropriate software architecture and a well-defined interface for array elements. This conference contribution describes exemplarily how the interface is implemented for the Medium-Sized Telescopes (MSTs; 12m diameter). The implementation uses the ALMA Common Software (ACS) as a framework for software applications facilitating the readout and control of telescope subsystems like the drive system or the pointing camera; the communication with subsystems takes advantage of the OPC UA protocol. It is also discussed what technologies (e.g. data bases) are used for the acquisition and storage of telescope-specific monitoring data.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mobr02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mobr02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mobr02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOBR02,77

In this context; hexapods are widely used to obtain a flexible and accurate 6 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) positioning system; as they are based on Parallel Kinematic Mechanisms (PKM). Aiming the customization and governability of this type of motion control system; a software application was entirely modeled and implemented at Sirius. A Bestec hexapod was used and the control logic was embedded into an Omron Delta Tau Power Brick towards the standardization of Sirius control solutions with features which completely fill the beamline scan needs; e.g. tracing arbitrary trajectories. Newton-Raphson numerical method was applied to implement the PKM. Besides; the kinematics was implemented in C language; targeting a better runtime performance when comparing to script languages.

In order to cope with the foreseen limitations; it was decided to replace the SW with a New SW (NSW) system; by combining two prototype detectors; the sTGC & and resistive Micromegas. Both technologies are ’aligned’ to the ATLAS general baselines for the NSW upgrade project; maintaining in such way the excellent performance of the muon system beyond Run-3. Complementary to the R&D of these detectors; an intuitive control system was of vital importance. The Micromegas DCS (MMG HV) and the sTGC DCS (STG HV) for the NSW have been developed; following closely the existing look; feel and command architecture of the other Muon sub-systems. The principal task of the DCS is to enable the coherent and safe operation of the detector by continuously monitoring its operational parameters and its overall state. Both technologies will be installed in ATLAS and will be readout and monitored through the common infrastructure. Aim of this work is the description of the development and implementation of a DCS for the HV system of both technologies.,,This paper has been submitted on behalf of the ATLAS Muon Collaboration,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mopv009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mopv009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mopv009_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOPV009,115

There are however many essential activities requiring personnel on site. In order to minimise the risks for its personnel CERN decided to take every measure possible; including internal contact tracing by the CERN medical service. This initially involved manual procedures which relied on people’s ability to remember past encounters. To improve this situation and minimise the number of employees who would need to be quarantined; CERN approved the design of a specific device: the Proximeter. The project goal was to design a wearable device; built in a partnership* with industry fulfilling the contact tracing needs of the medical service. The proximeter records other devices in close proximity and reports the encounters to a cloud-based system. The service came into operation early 2021 and 8000 devices were distributed to personnel working on the CERN site.

Our objective was to allow users to access the alarms fast; remotely and without special software. According to current trends in the IT community; creating a web application turned out to be a perfect solution. Our application is the extension and web equivalent to the current Panic GUI application. It allows constant remote access using just a web browser which is currently present on every machine including mobile phones and tablets. The access to the different functionalities can be restricted to the users provided just with appropriate roles.

In practice; this change of status was as much pragmatic as it was progressive - Python has been available as part of the underlying operating system for over a decade and unofficial Python interfaces to controls have existed since at least 2015. So one might ask: what really changed when Python’s adoption became official? This paper will discuss what it takes to officially support Python in a controls environment and will focus on the cultural and technological shifts involved in running Python operationally. It will highlight some of the infrastructure that has been put in place at CERN to facilitate a stable and user-friendly Python platform; as well as some of the key decisions that have led to Python thriving in CERN’s accelerator controls domain.

The major difficulties in building C++ software are to ensure that the artifacts are compatible with the target system’s (OS; Application Binary Interface); and to ensure that transitive dependent libraries are compatible when linked together. Thus developers/maintainers must be provided with efficient tooling for friction-less workflows: standardisation of the project description and build; automatic CI; flexible development environment. The open-source community with services like Github and Gitlab have set high expectations with regards to developer user experience. This paper describes how we leveraged Conan and CMake to standardise the build of C++ projects; avoid the ""dependency hell"" and provide an easy way to distribute C++ packages. A CI system orchestrated by Jenkins and based on automatic job definition and in-source; versioned; configuration has been implemented.

The international scientific collaboration responsible for this project requested low and high resolution acquisition at a capture rate of 10Hz and 1 Hz respectively. To match these requirements; GigE digital cameras were connected to a PXI system running PharLap; a real-time operating system; using dual port 1GB/s network cards. With new requirements for a faster acquisition with higher resolution; it was decided to add 10GB/s network cards and a Network Attached Storage (NAS) directly connected to the PXI system to avoid saturating the network. There was also a request to acquire high-resolution images on several cameras during a limited duration; typically 30 seconds; in a burst acquisition mode. To comply with these new requirements PharLap had to be abandoned and replaced with Linux RT.

icalepcs2021,,MOPV046,Tango Controls Device Attribute extension in Python3,T. Snijder; T. Juerges; J.J.D. Mol; ASTRON; Dwingeloo; The Netherlands; The Tango Controls Device Attributes represent a container for read-only or read-write data types. However the Attribute read/write functions need to be individually implemented for accessing structured data in hardware devices. This exposes a pattern of replicated code in the read and write functions. Maintaining this code becomes time consuming to maintain when a Device exposes tens or more Attributes. The solution we propose is to extend Tango Control Attributes. For that we combine a hardware access class (accessor) that reads and writes the structured data in hardware together with a small addition to the original Attribute declaration. The extended Attribute constructor provides information that describes how the accessor can locate a value in the hardware. This information is then used to provide the extended Attribute with a parameterised read or write function. The benefits of our solution are that various methods of hardware access can be efficiently and easily implemented and that new extended Attributes can be added with a single line of code. We have successfully used the extended Attributes with OPC-UA; SNMP; and INI-files in ASTRON’s,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/mopv046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/mopv046.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/mopv046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-MOPV046,

In recent years; this protocol has gained support from many vendors of both hardware and software components; thus significantly reducing the efforts needed to integrate components from different vendors. We have developed an EPICS device support that is based on the open62541 open-source library for use at the accelerator facilities operated by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. This device support acts as an OPC UA client; enabling the integration of hardware components (e.g. programmable logic controllers) as well as software components (e.g. third-party control-system frameworks) into our EPICS based control systems. In this contribution; we present this EPICS device support; which is publicly available under an open-source license.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/tubr05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/tubr05.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/tubr05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-TUBR05,

Granite benches were developed to couple the optical device to the floor and allow automatic movements; via com-manded setpoints on EPICS that runs an embedded kinematics; during base installation; alignment; commis-sioning and operation of the beamline. They are com-posed by stages and each application has its own geome-try; a set number of Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) and mo-tors; all controlled by Omron Delta Tau Power Brick LV. In particular; the mirror system was the precursor motion control system for other benches. Since the me-chanical design aims on stiffness; the axes of mirror are not controlled directly; the actuators are along the granite bench.

Both concave mirrors focus the X-ray beam by reflecting it at small grazing angles. The relocation of this system from UVX XDS beamline to Sirius EMA beamline facilitated a full revision of the motion control system; whose controller was migrated to Omron Delta Tau Power Brick LV. The beam focus is controlled by bending the mirrors through camshaft mechanisms cou-pled to low current Faulhaber motors. Although the am-plifier is designed for higher currents; controller settings allowed the use of lower currents. Another improvement made is the ability to drive both bender motors in gantry mode and still control the lag between them. Each bender has a capacitive sensor to monitor the position of the center of the mirror; which is read by the analog input of the controller and made available by EPICS [1]. The VFM is supported by a tripod and a new kinematics was devel-oped to reference the center of the mirror as the point of control.

It is operated using the SCADA system WinCC by Siemens. The majority of ELBE systems is connected to WinCC via industrial Ethernet and proprietary S7 communication. However; in recent years new subsystems had to be integrated into the existing infrastructure; which do not provide S7 communication interfaces. Instead; OPC UA has been chosen for system integration. We will show how we use OPC UA as a common communication layer between industrial and scientific instruments as well as proprietary and open source control system software. For example; OPC UA support has been implemented for the ChimeraTK framework developed at DESY. ChimeraTK is used at ELBE e.g. for integrating MicroTCA.4 based subsystems like the digital LLRF system. Furthermore; we are developing a machine data interface for ELBE users. In combination with a certification authority; which hands out user certificates for data access; external users can gain read and write access to different ELBE subsystem data provided by a single OPC UA server.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/tupv010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/tupv010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/tupv010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-TUPV010,400

EPICS is a set of software tools used to build control systems for large scientific instruments such as particle accelerators. A prototype of communication between Inovance PLC and EPICS IOC was built by using a Inovance AC812 PLC controller. In order to simplify the system structure and reduce the development cost; the EPICS IOC was run in the AC812 PLC controller while running standard PLC program. The PLC program running in the AC812 PLC controller communicates with the EPICS IOC through the Modbus protocol; so as to integrate the data from the AC812 PLC controller into the EPICS IOC. Based on the brief introduction of EPICS; AC812 PLC controller and EPICS Modbus driver; the communication between the AC812 PLC controller and the EPICS IOC using EPICS Modbus drivers was tested.

To produce these photocathodes; two processes run in parallel. The first process; which is slow and asynchronous; controls and monitors the evaporation of photoemissive material. For this first step several power supplies are controlled to evaporate different metals through the Joule effect; with the power maintained constant in time and the thickness deposited monitored. The second process is synchronized with a laser trigger ranging from 0.1 to 50Hz; where the photocurrent and laser energy are measured to calculate the Quantum Efficiency. The control system for these processes has recently been renovated to benefit from the modularity of a PXI-based real-time environment using the standard CERN MiddleWare communication layer (CMW). This paper describes the challenges of the fabrication process as well as the flexibility introduced by using a PXI system.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/tupv032_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/tupv032.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/tupv032_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-TUPV032,464

Individual Devices are therefore controlled transactionally. Operators often need to apply a set of changes which affect multiple devices. This is achieved by sending requests in parallel; in a minimum amount of time. However; if a request fails; the Control system ends up in an undefined state; and recovering is a time-consuming task. Furthermore; the lack of synchronisation in the application of new settings may lead to the degradation of the beam characteristics; because of settings being partially applied. To address these issues; a protocol was developed to support distributed transactions and commit synchronisation in the CERN Control system; which was then implemented in CERN’s real-time frameworks. We describe what this protocol intends to solve and its limitations. We also delve into the real-time framework implementation and how developers can benefit from the 2-phase commit to leverage hardware features such as double buffering; and from the commit synchronisation allowing settings to be changed safely while the accelerator is operational.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/tupv033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/tupv033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/tupv033_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-TUPV033,468

Full deployment is aimed on all beamlines by the end of 2023. BLISS is an all-in-one solution for beamline experiments; ranging from experiment control sequences and data acquisition to live visualization. BLISS is entirely written in Python and integrates seamlessly into Python tool chains. ESRF beamline staff and users alike can benefit from thousands of Python packages at their fingertips to improve data acquisition sequences. The BLISS team; which is part of the Beamline Control Unit within the Software Group; is in charge of the BLISS development. All primary objectives have been reached and nowadays the BLISS team is working on improving parts of the system ; most notably; focus is put on the interaction with other ESRF software like Daiquiri; our web framework for graphical applications; or online data analysis. This paper describes the actual state of BLISS and presents newest; most innovative features; that put BLISS at the heart of the ESRF data acquisition ecosystem.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/tupv043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/tupv043.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/tupv043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-TUPV043,

Karabo uses broker-based communication between its pluggable components; so-called devices. The generic; PyQt-based graphical user interface (GUI) interacts with the system via a TCP connection to a GUI server device. The travel and contact restrictions enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have prevented many facility users from coming on site. In order to enable an easier remote user participation in experiments; a read-only version of the GUI server has been developed ad-hoc; and made available during Summer 2020. Obviously; easy and safe remote access has advantages beyond the current travel restrictions. Therefore; activities to provide a web-technology based front-end to Karabo have been accelerated.

Over the last couple of years we have added support for reflectometry and muon instruments; developed a script generator; moved from Python 2 to Python 3; and continued to build on our suite of device emulators and tests. The reflectometry inclusions required the development of a framework to maintain the complex motion control requirements for that science technique. Whilst it is desirable that IBEX is easily configurable; not all operations should be available to all users; so we have implemented functionality to manage such access. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant we have also had to adapt to greater amounts of remote experiment access; for which we developed systems covering both IBEX and the old SECI control system.

The IBEX Script Generator enables collaboration between instrument users and scientists to remove the need to write a script for many experiments; so improving reliability and control. For maximum applicability; the script generator needs to be easily configurable. Instrument scientists define action parameters; and functions for action execution; time estimation and validation; to produce a ""script definition"". A user then generates a Python script by organising a table of actions and their values; which are validated in real time; and can then be submitted to a script server for execution. Py4J is used to bridge a Java front end with Python script definitions. An iterative user-focused approach has been employed with Squish UI testing to achieve a behaviour-driven development workflow; along with Jenkins for continuous integration.

The equipment can achieve millisecond pressure jumps for use in X-ray scattering experiments. It has been routinely available in beamline I22 at Diamond. The millisecond pressure-jump capability is unique. Example applications were the demonstration of pressure-induced formation of super crystals from PEGylated gold nanoparticles and the study of controlled assembly and disassembly of nanoscale protein cages. The project goal was to migrate the control system for the improved integration to EPICS and the GDA data acquisition software. The original control system uses National Instruments hardware controlled from LabView. The project looked at mapping the old control system hardware to alternatives in use at Diamond and migrating the control software.

The optical Thompson scattering (OTS) laser has been developed to understand the target implosion physics; especially for under-dense plasma conditions. A 5w probe beams can be set up for diagnosing various plasma densities. Just as the NIF laser with 192 laser beams are precisely aligned; the OTS system also requires precision alignment using a series of automated closed loop control steps. CCD images from the OTS laser (OTSL) beams are analyzed using a suite of image processing algorithm. The algorithms provide beam position measurements that are used to control motorized mirrors that steer beams to their defined desired location.

In order to overcome this limitation we have introduced a new automation framework for shifting the logics from GUIs to server side; where simple tasks can be easily organized; inspected and stacked up to build more complex actions. This tool is based on Behavior Trees (BT) which has been recently adopted in the gaming industry for in-game AI player opponents. They are able to create very complex tasks composed by simple decoupled self-contained tasks (nodes); regardless how they are implemented.

In addition to high neutron counts rates the expected large number of dynamic measurements per day calls for a flexible system that supports a high variability in sample set-ups. Apache Kafka has been chosen as the central data switchboard to handle all the event driven data sources from detectors as well as from the EPICS controls system. The file writing system centres around a facility wide pool of HDF5 file-writers that uses Apache Kafka also for command and control. File-writing jobs are posted to a topic on Apache Kafka and picked up by individual workers. This centralises and optimises resources; as I/O load can be balanced between different neutron instruments. Command messages embed a NeXus compliant structure to capture the raw data in a community agreed format.

The library is capable of creating packets with default values; autocompleting packets according to the protocol and it allows the construction of packets from raw data. Malformed packets can be intentionally crafted and the response of the application under test is checked for protocol conformance. New test cases can be added to the test case dictionary.

Moreover; high-coupling might manifest at any tier of the I&C; and certainly spans configuration parameters across both conventional and machine-protection I&C. Stemming from ITER design guidelines; the handling of machine-protection configuration parameters needs to meet the goals of IEC61508-3. These goals are mostly in congruence with the main concerns of integrated supervision identified above. However they also extend requirements that bind the supervision process with traceability and audit capabilities from sources to final self-test (run-time) diagnostics.

Hence; positioning requirements span from nanometer-level errors for high-resolution experiments to fast continuous trajectories for high throughput; whereas a large flexibility is required for different sample setups and simultaneous multi-technique X-ray analyses; including tomography.

Now; for beamlines requiring a smaller energy range (3.1 to 43 keV; as compared to 2.3 to 72 keV); there is the opportunity to adapt the existing design towards the so-called HD-DCM-Lite. The control architecture of the HD-DCM is kept; reaching a 20 kHz control rate in NI’s CompactRIO (cRIO). Yet; the smaller gap stroke between crystals allows for removing the long-stroke mechanism and reducing the main inertia by a factor 6; not only simplifying the dynamics of the system; but also enabling faster energy scans. With sinusoidal scans of hundreds of eV up to 20 Hz; this creates an unparalleled bridge between slow step-scan DCMs; and channel-cut quick-EXAFS monochromators.

Efficiency of an accelerator facility is measured as a ratio of experiment time to beam optimization time. At RBI we have four ion sources; two accelerators; ten experimental end stations. We can obtain around 50 different ion species; each requiring a different set of parameters for optimal operation. Automating repetitive procedures can increase efficiency of an experiment and beam setup time. Currently; operators manually fine tunes the parameters to optimize the beam current. This process can be very long and requires many iterations. Automatic optimization of parameters can save valuable accelerator time. Based on a successful implementation of EPICS; the system was expanded to automate reoccurring procedures. To achieve this; a PLC was integrated into EPICS and our acquisition system was modified to communicate with devices through EPICS.

To facilitate the creation and execution of operational procedures in a robust and repeatable way; a software framework was developed: the Sequencer. As a supporting framework for tasks that are mostly goal-oriented; the Sequencer’s semantics are based on a behavior tree model that also supports concurrent flows of execution. In view of its intended use in very diverse situations; from small scale tests to full integrated operation; the architecture was designed to be composable and extensible from the start. User interactions with the Sequencer are fully decoupled and can be linked through dependency injection. The Sequencer library is currently feature-complete and comes with a command line interface for the encapsulation of procedures as system daemons or simple interactive use.

The collimators are positioned around the beam respecting a strict transverse hierarchy. The position of each collimator is determined following a beam-based alignment technique which determines the required jaw settings for optimum performance. During the LHC Run 2 (2015-2018); a new automatic alignment software package was developed and used for collimator alignments throughout 2018*. This paper discusses the usability and flexibility of this new package describing the implementation in detail; as well as the latest improvements and features in preparation for Run 3 starting in 2022. The automation has already successfully decreased the alignment time by 70% in 2018** and this paper explores how to further exploit this software package. Its implementation provides a solid foundation to automatically align any new collimation configurations in the future; as well as allows for further analysis and upgrade of its individual modules.; *G.Azzopardi; et al""Software Architecture for Automatic LHC Collimator Alignment using ML""",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/wepv016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/wepv016.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/wepv016_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-WEPV016,659

The source operates with 800µs long pulses at 1.2 second intervals. The stability of the beam intensity from the source requires adjustment of parameters like RF power used for plasma heating. The Linac4 Source Autopilot improves the stability and uptime of the source; by using high-level automation to monitor and control Device parameters of the source; in a time range of minutes to days. This paper describes the Autopilot framework; which incorporates standard CERN accelerator Controls infrastructure; and enables users to add domain specific code for their needs. User code typically runs continuously; adapting Device settings based on acquisitions. Typical use cases are slow feedback systems and procedure automation (e.g. resetting equipment). The novelty of the Autopilot is the successful integration of the Controls software based predominantly on Java technologies; with domain specific user code written in Python. This allows users to leverage a robust Controls infrastructure; with minimal effort; using the agility of the Python ecosystem.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/wepv018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/wepv018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/wepv018_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-WEPV018,665

Structures must be subjected to a conditioning process before operational use; in which the gradient is gradually increased up to the operating value. A limiting effect during this process is breakdown or vacuum arcing; which can cause damage that limits the ultimate operating gradient. Techniques to efficiently condition the cavities while minimising the number of breakdowns are therefore important. In this paper; machine learning techniques are applied to detect breakdown events in RF pulse traces by approaching the problem as anomaly detection; using a variational autoencoder. This process detects deviations from normal operation and classifies them with near perfect accuracy. Offline data from various sources has been used to develop the techniques; which we aim to test at the CLARA facility at Daresbury Laboratory.

When deploying the prototype in the same scale as the BIS; which consists of 5 PLC stations with roughly 400 signals; the response time is estimated to be over 10 ms; which means that it is too long to protect the equipment when the intensity of the beam accelerated at RIBF becomes higher. Therefore; we are starting to redesign a system by adding a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to shorten the response time significantly rather than repeating minor improvements to save a few milliseconds.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/wepv038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/wepv038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/wepv038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-WEPV038,742

SXFEL-TF has met all the design specifications and has been available in beam operating state. SXFEL-UF is currently under commissioning and is planned to generate 3 nm FEL radiation using a 1.5 GeV electron LINAC. To protect the critical equipment rapidly and effectively from unexpected damage; a reliable safety interlocking system needs to be designed. Machine Protection System (MPS) is designed by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) which is based on a master-slave architecture. In order to meet different commissioning and operation requirements; the management and switching functions of eight operation modes are introduced in the MPS system.

It will accelerate proton beam pulses to a Tungsten wheel to generate neutrons by the spallation effect. For such beam; the Machine Protection System (MPS) at ESS must be fast and reliable; and for this reason a Fast Beam Interlock System (FBIS) based on FPGAs is required. Some protection functions monitoring slow values (like temperature; mechanical movements; magnetic fields) need however less strict reaction times and are managed by PLCs. The communications protocol established between PLCs and FBIS is PROFINET fieldbus based. The Anybus CompactCom allows an host to have connectivity to industrial networks as PROFINET. In this context; FBIS represents the host and the application code to interface the AnyBus CompactCom has been fully developed in VHDL.

This often leads to the design of configurable software that can absorb these changes and perform the required control and protection actions. This design strategy minimizes the engineering and maintenance costs; but it makes the software verification activities more challenging since safety properties must be guaranteed for any of the possible configurations. Software model checking is a popular automated verification technique in many industries. This verification method explores all possible combinations of the system model to guarantee its compliance with certain properties or specification. This is a very appropriate technique for highly configurable software; since there is usually an enormous amount of combinations to be checked. This paper presents how PLCverif; a CERN model checking platform; has been applied to a highly configurable Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) program; the SPS Personnel Protection System (PPS).

The new Target Internal Dump Vertical Graphite (TIDVG#5) is designed to withstand an average dumped beam power as high as 235 kW to cope with the increased intensity and brightness of the LIU beams whose energies in the SPS range from 14 to 450 GeV. Considering such highly demanding specifications; the constant monitoring of the device’s status and the characteristics of the beams that are dumped to it is of utmost importance to guarantee an efficient operation with little or no limitations. While the former is ensured with several internal temperature sensors; a Beam Observation system based on a scintillating screen and a digital camera is installed to extract the profile of the beam dumped in TIDVG#5 for post mortem analysis.

Integrating with the BSS allows us to configure the beam execution directly from the settings management system. Defining signals and conditions enables us to control the runtime behavior of the machine. The storage ring mode supports flexible operation with features allowing to pause the machine and execute in-cycle modifications; using concepts like breakpoints; repetitions; skipping; and manipulation.

A substantial amount of these signals - i.e. PVs - will be stored by the Archiving Service; a service that is currently under development at the Integrated Control System (ICS) Division. From a technical point of view; the Archiving Service is implemented using a software application called the Archiver Appliance. This application; originally developed at SLAC; records PVs as a function of time and stores these in its persistent layer.

Here we will describe several advanced methods for using these models in accelerator characterization and optimization.

Using containerization solutions provides many advantages; such as: applications running in an isolated manner; decoupled from the operating system and its libraries; run-time dependencies; including access to persistent storage; are clearly declared. However; introducing these new techniques requires significant modifications of existing computing infrastructure as well as a cultural change.

This paper will detail a proof of concept to demonstrate replacing these tools and processes with modern industry standards. IOCs are packaged in containers with their unique dependencies included. IOC images are generic; and a single image is required for all containers that control a given class of device. Configuration is provided to the container in the form of a start-up script only. The configuration allows the generic IOC image to bootstrap a container for a unique IOC instance. This approach keeps the number of images required to a minimum. Container orchestration for all beamlines in the facility is provided through a central Kubernetes cluster. The cluster has remote nodes that reside within each beamline network to host the IOCs for the local beamline. All source; images and individual IOC configurations are held in repositories. Build and deployment to the production registries is handled by continuous integration.

Today; the OASIS installation counts over 500 multiplexed digitisers; capable of digitising more than 5000 analogue signals and offers a selection of more than 250 triggers for the acquisitions. These triggers are mostly generated at a single central place and are then distributed by means of a dedicated coaxial cable per digitiser; using a ""star"" topology. An upgrade is currently under way to renovate this trigger distribution system and migrate it to a White Rabbit (WR) based solution. In this new system; triggers are distributed in the form of Ethernet messages over a WR network; allowing for better scalability; higher time-stamping precision; trigger latency compensation and improved robustness.

In the old system, the digital signal processing was clocked by a submultiple of the RF. The new system uses a fixed-frequency clock derived from White Rabbit (WR). This triggered the development of an eRTM module for generating very precise clock signals to be fed to the optional RF backplane in MTCA.4 crates. The eRTM14/15 sandwich of modules implements a WR node delivering clock signals with a jitter below 100 fs. WR-clocked RF synthesis inside the FPGA makes it simple to reproduce the RF elsewhere by broadcasting the frequency-tuning words over the WR network itself. These words are received by the WR2RF-VME module and used to produce beam-synchronous signals such as the bunch clock and the revolution tick. This paper explains the general architecture of this new LLRF system, highlighting the role of WR-based synchronization.

Our BDT approach offers an alternative to existing packages; including those that implement neural networks on FPGA; with less dependence of DSP utilization that is replaced by other resources. Our design philosophy is to remove clocked operations in favor of combinatoric logic through High Level Synthesis. The firmware implementation of binary classification requiring 100 training trees with a maximum depth of 4 using four input variables gives a latency value of about 10ns at various clock speeds. We optimize the parameters using a software package; which interfaces to Xilinx Vivado through High Level Synthesis.

Recently; we successfully used PyQt 5 to renovate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) used to control the CERN accelerator timing system. The GUI application interfaces with a Java-based service behind the scenes. In this paper we introduce the generic architecture used for this project; our development workflow as well as the challenges and lessons we learned from using Python with Qt. We present our approach to delivering an operational application with a particular focus on testing; quality assurance; and continuous integration.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/thpv015_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/thpv015.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/thpv015_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-THPV015,904

The upcoming migration from the Vista Control Systems product Vsystem to EPICS provides the right opportunity and framework for a ‘fresh start’ to review and rationalise the alarms. Internationally recognised good engineering practice is defined in the IEC-62682 / ISA 18.2 Standards for the Management of Alarm Systems for the Process Industries; which describe the Alarm Management Lifecycle: an ongoing process of continuous improvement to be used to manage alarms in control systems. The Lifecycle begins with the development of an Alarm Philosophy; which establishes the basic definitions; principles and processes to design; implement and maintain an alarm system. The development of an Alarm Philosophy for the new EPICS Control system at ISIS is outlined; setting out the basis for the identification; classification and prioritisation of alarms. The challenges of managing the transition of the alarms from Vsystem to EPICS are discussed; including the outcome of initial work applying the Alarm Philosophy to rationalising the existing Vsystem alarms.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/thpv016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/thpv016.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/thpv016_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-THPV016,

As the demand on accelerator operations increases so does the need for automated tuning algorithms and control to maximize uptime with reduced operator intervention. Existing tools are insufficient to meet the broad demands on controls; visualization; and analysis. We have developed a cloud based toolbox featuring a generic virtual accelerator control room for the development of automated tuning algorithms and the analysis of large complex datasets. This framework utilizes tracking codes combined with with algorithms for machine drift; low-level control systems; and other complications to create realistic models of accelerators. These models are directly interfaced with control toolboxes allowing for rapid prototyping of tuning algorithms. In this paper; we will provide an overview of our interface and demonstrate its utility for building beamline controls displays directly from accelerator simulation lattices.

For most beamlines of the fourth-generation source SIRIUS; it was imperative to shift from the usual software-based synchronization of operations to the much faster triggering by hardware of some key equipment involved in the experiments. As a basis of their control system for devices; the SIRIUS beamlines have standard CompactRIO controllers and I/O modules along the hutches. Equipped with a FPGA and a hard processor running Linux Real-Time; this platform could deal with the triggers from and to other devices; in the order of ms and µs. TATU (Time and Trigger Unit) is a code running in a CompactRIO unit to coordinate multiple triggering conditions and actions. TATU can be either the master pulse generator or the follower of other signals. Complex trigger pattern generation is set from a user-friendly standardized interface.

The trigger signals is usually generated at the same phase of an AC power line to reduce the unwanted variation of the beam quality. This requirement originates from the power supply systems. However; the AC line synchronization conflicts with the bucket selection process of SuperKEKB low energy ring (LER) which stores the positron beam. The positron beam is firstly injected into a damping ring (DR) to lower the emittance before entering desired RF bucket in LER. A long bucket selection cycle for DR and LER makes it difficult to coincide with AC line every injection pulse. This trouble is solved by grouping several injection pulses into various of injection sequences and manipulating the length of sequences to adjust the AC line arrival timing. Therefore; the timing system is sensitive to drastically AC line fluctuation. The failure of timing system caused by strong AC line fluctuation and solutions are introduced in this work.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/thpv028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/thpv028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/thpv028_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-THPV028,923

An alignment procedure determines the settings of each collimator; by moving the collimator jaws towards the beam until a characteristic loss pattern; consisting of a sharp rise followed by a slow decay; is observed in downstream beam loss monitors. This indicates that the collimator jaw intercepted the reference beam halo and is thus aligned to the beam. The latest alignment software introduced in 2018 relies on supervised machine learning (ML) to detect such spike patterns in real-time*. This enables the automatic alignment of the collimators with a significant reduction in the alignment time**. This paper analyses the first-use performance of this new software focusing on solutions to the identified bottleneck caused by waiting a fixed duration of time when detecting spikes. It is proposed to replace the supervised ML model with a Long-Short Term Memory model able to detect spikes in time windows of varying lengths; waiting for a variable duration of time determined by the spike itself. This will allow to further speed up the automatic alignment.; *G. Azzopardi et al.; ""Automatic spike detection in beam loss signals for LHC collimator alignment""; NIMA 2019. **G.

The framework has been successfully used for nearly 100 different analyses that ran regularly by the end of the LHC run 2. Currently it is being updated for run 3 with modern and efficient tools to improve its usability and data analysis power. In particular; the architecture has been reviewed to have a modular design to facilitate the maintenance and the future evolution of the tool. A new web based application is being developed to facilitate the users’ access both to online configuration and to results. This paper will describe all these evolutions and outline possible lines of work for further improvements.; * ""A Framework for Off-Line Verification of Beam Instrumentation Systems at CERN""; S.

With the SRF cavities at high gradients; the field emission of electrons from cavity walls can occur and will impact the operational gradient; radiological environment via activated components; and reliability of CEBAF’s two linacs. A new effort has started to minimize field emission in the CEBAF linacs by re-distributing cavity gradients. To measure radiation levels; newly designed neutron and gamma radiation dose rate monitors have been installed in both linacs. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques will be used to identify cavities with high levels of field emission based on control system data such as radiation levels; cryogenic readbacks; and vacuum loads. The gradients on the most offending cavities will be reduced and compensated for by increasing the gradients on least offensive cavities. Training data will be collected during this year’s operational program and initial implementation of AI models will be deployed.

We present the software architecture of the Monitoring; Logging and Alarm subsystems in the ACADA framework. The Monitoring System (MON) is the subsystem that addresses the acquisition of the monitoring and logging information from the CTA array elements. The MON will also support corrective and predictive maintenance to minimize the downtime of the system. The Array Alarm System (AAS) is the subsystem that is responsible for collecting alarms from telescopes; array calibration and environmental monitoring instruments; and the ACADA systems itself. The final software deployment is expected to manage about 200.000 monitoring points sampled between 1 and 5 Hz for a maximum data rate for writing operations of 26 Mbps for the monitoring system including the alarms; and a maximum rate of about 1 Gbps for the aggregated log information.

The largest of the new trackers is based on the scintillating fibres (SciFi) read out by SIlicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPMs). The SiPMs will be cooled down to -40°C to minimize noise. For performance and space reasons; the cooling lines are vacuum insulated. Ionizing radiation requires detaching and displace the readout electronics from Pirani gauges to a lower radiation area. To avoid condensation inside the SiPM boxes; the atmosphere inside must have a dew point of at most -45°C. The low dew point will be achieved by flushing a dry gas through the box. 576 flowmeters devices will be installed to monitor the gas flow continuously. A Condensation Prevention System (CPS) has been introduced as condensation was observed. The CPS powers heating wires installed around the SiPM boxes and the vacuum bellows isolating the cooling lines. The CPS also includes 672 temperature sensors to monitor that all parts are warmer than the cavern dew point.

AZINT is used extensively in photon science experiments; in particular in small angle scattering and powder diffraction. It improves signal to noise ratio and data volumes are reduced by a factor of 1000. The underlaying procedure i.e. bin-counting has other applications. The potential of FPGAs for data analysis originates from recent progress in FPGA software design with complexity matching the scientific requirements. We implemented AZINT on FPGAs using OpenCL and synchronous message exchange (SME). It is demonstrated AZINT can process 600 Gb/s streams; i.e. about 20’40 Gpixels/s; on a single FPGA. FPGAs are usually more energy-efficient than GPUs; they are flexible so they can fit a specific problem and outperform GPUs in relevant applications; in particular AZINT here. Beside high throughput FPGAs allow data processing with well-defined and low latencies for real-time experiments. Radiation tolerance of FPGAs brings more synergies. It makes them ideal components for extra-terrestrial scientific instruments (e.g. Mars rovers) or detectors at spaceflights and satellites.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/frbl04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/frbl04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/frbl04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-FRBL04,

Such developments are driving the creation of novel solutions to visualize large datasets both during and after image acquisition. Towards this end; we have devised a library called RemoteVis to visualize large volumes remotely in HPC nodes; using NVIDIA IndeX as the rendering backend. RemoteVis relies on RDMA-based data transfer to move large volumes from local HPC servers; possibly connected to X-ray detectors; to remote dedicated nodes containing multiple GPUs for distributed volume rendering. RemoteVis then injects the transferred data into IndeX for rendering. IndeX is a scalable software capable of using multiple nodes and GPUs to render large volumes in full resolution. As such; we have coupled RemoteVis with slurm to dynamically schedule one or multiple HPC nodes to render any given dataset. RemoteVis was written in C/C++ and Python; providing an efficient API that requires only two functions to 1) start remote IndeX instances and 2) render regular volumes and point-cloud (diffraction) data on the web browser/Jupyter client.; *NVIDIA IndeX; https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-index,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/frbl05_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/frbl05.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/frbl05_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-FRBL05,

Arc welding; machine tending; painting; picking; are only some examples where the robot manipulators are widely employed. In Synchrotrons some process can benefit from robotic approaches in order to improve automation. Automatic Sample Changer on beamlines is the most common example of automation. This paper describes two robotic applications developed at Synchrotron SOLEIL. Both applications use the SOLEIL robotic standard introduced some years ago [1]. The first application aims to automate the exchange of samples for powder diffraction experiment on the CRISTAL beamline. Hence; a pick-and-place robot is used to automate the process of picking up the sample holders and placing them on the goniometer. The second application; also of the pick-and-place type; is dedicated to the automation of the magnetic characterization of magnet modules of an U15 undulator. These modules; built with a permanent magnet and two poles; are measured using a pulsed wire method [2]. In this case; the robot picks the modules stored in boxes to then place them on the test bench of the U15 undulator.; *Y.-M.

Existing workflows require significant specialization to account for beamline-specific operations and pre-processing steps in order to collect and prepare data for more sophisticated analysis. Recent efforts to address these needs at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) have resulted in the creation of the Bluesky data collection framework*; an open-source library providing for experimental control and scientific data collection via high level abstraction of experimental procedures; instrument readouts; and data analysis. We present a prototype data management interface that couples with Bluesky to support guided simulation; measurement; and rapid processing operations. Initial demonstrations illustrate application to coherent X-ray scattering beamlines at the NSLS-II. We then discuss extensions of this interface to permit analysis operations across distributed computing resources; including the use of the Sirepo scientific framework; as well as Jupyter notebooks running on remote computing clusters**.; * M.S.

To interface with the hardware Bluesky relies on the Ophyd library; that provides a consistent high-level interface across a wide-range of devices. Many elements of the accelerator; some beamlines and endstations are adopting the Bluesky software. To meet FAIR data obligations; the capture of metadata with Bluesky and the export into a permanent and easily accessible storage called ICAT are investigated. Finally; initial studies to investigate the integration of ML methods; like reinforcement learning were performed. This paper reports on the work that has been done so far at BESSY II to adopt Bluesky; problems that have been overcome and lessons learned.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/frbr03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/frbr03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/frbr03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-FRBR03,

This also increases the risk of sample radiation damage. We have developed a system where scans are performed while continuously moving the motors. To ensure stable repeatable measurements; the detector triggers are generated; in hardware; from the motor encoder positions. Before the scan starts; a list of positions is generated and as the scan progresses a trigger is produced as each successive position in the list is reached. The encoder signals from the motors are connected both to the IcePAP motion controller for closed loop operation; and a PandABox which is used as the trigger source. Control is from Tango and Sardana with a TriggerGate controller that calculates the motor positions and configures the PandABox. The scanned motor can be either a single motor; for example a sample positioner; or a combined motion like a monochromator. When combined motions are required; these make use of the parametric trajectory mode of the IcePAP. This enables continuous scans of coupled axes with non-linear paths.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/frbr04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/frbr04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/frbr04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-FRBR04,

In order to facilitate operation and maintenance; Low-level control has been successfully transferred from its original proprietary controller to a SOLEIL-standardized controller (Delta Tau Power Brick). Low-level control includes direct and reverse kinematics which can be adapted and tuned to the specific mechanical/geometric features of any Stewart Platform of similar build. The embedded (and therefore generic to Stewart Platforms) software also interfaces with generic and existing Tango devices making it easily accessible by users. The transition from ’black-box’ hardware and embedded software to standardized controllers with fully mastered control kinematics; provides hexapod users with SOLEIL durable operational support and maintenance. Dimensional metrology of the hexapod has shown dynamic and static performance to be equivalent to the old system. A new metrological method linking measurements and kinematics has been developed to compensate mechanical imperfections in order to improve performance.

MXAimbot uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a few thousands images from an industrial vision camera pointed at the sample to predict suitable crystal centering for subsequent X-ray data collection. The motivation for this project is that the machine vision automated sample positioning allows X-ray laboratories and synchrotron beamlines to offer a more efficient alternative for the manual centering; which is time consuming and difficult to automate with conventional image analysis; and for the X-ray mesh scan centering; which can introduce radiation damage to the crystal. MXAimbot can be used to improve results of standard LUCID loop centering for fully automated data collection in fragment-screening campaigns. No need for sample rotation should be an additional advantage.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/talks/frbr06_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/papers/frbr06.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/icalepcs2021/posters/frbr06_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ICALEPCS2021-FRBR06,
