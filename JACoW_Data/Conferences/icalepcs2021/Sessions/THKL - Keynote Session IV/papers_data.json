        "is the first interferometer with less than 1 wavenumber spectral resolution that works on geostationary orbit. GIIRS takes measurements of three dimensional atmospheric structure from interference of split light beams",
        "complementing the advanced IR sounders in polar orbit. It measures the infrared radiation spectrum distribution in the middle and long wave infrared spectra of the earth by using the Fourier spectroscopic technique. GIIRS provides breakthrough measurements with the temporal",
