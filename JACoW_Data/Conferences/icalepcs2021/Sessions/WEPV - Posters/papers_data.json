It is highly maintainable due to its small and low complexity code base and dependencies to third party libraries are properly encapsulated."

Using real-time magnetic field intensity as the feedback to adjust the magnetic field current input can be a promising strategy. However",

An Adaptive fusion algorithm is used to fused collected values to obtain the best estimate of the magnetic field intensity. This system effectively improves the accuracy of magnetic field measurement and ensures the instantaneity of the measurement."

SXFEL-TF has met all the design specifications and has been available in beam operating state. SXFEL-UF is currently under commissioning and is planned to generate 3 nm FEL radiation using a 1.5 GeV electron LINAC. To protect the critical equipment rapidly and effectively from unexpected damage",
