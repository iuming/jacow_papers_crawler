        "such as cooling and ventilation or electrical distribution alarms",
        "while maintaining integrity and availability. Distributed caching is a common technique to dramatically increase the availability and fault tolerance of redundant systems. For C2MON we have replaced the existing legacy Terracotta caching framework with Apache Ignite. Ignite is an enterprise grade",
        "distributed caching platform",
        "with advanced cloud-native capabilities. It enables C2MON to handle high volumes of data with full transaction support and makes C2MON ready to run in the cloud. This article first explains the challenges we met when integrating Apache Ignite into the C2MON framework",
        "and then demonstrates how Ignite enhances the capabilities of a monitor and control system in an industrial controls environment."

SKA is highly focused on adopting CI/CD practices for its software development. CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration \\& Delivery and/or Deployment. Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all developers’ local copies into the mainline frequently. Continuous Delivery is the approach of developing software in short cycles ensuring it can be released anytime",
        "and Continuous Deployment is the approach of delivering the software into operational use frequently and automatically. This paper analyses the decisions taken by the Systems Team (a specialized agile team devoted to developing and maintaining the tools that allow continuous practices) to promote the CI/CD practices with the TANGO-controls framework."
