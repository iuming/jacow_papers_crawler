        "faster processing) in various subsystems of the accelerator and beamlines",
        "our electronics and control system experts had the task to evaluate alternatives to the existing VME technology and build a new portfolio of electronic hardware tools accordingly. CompactPCI-Serial was chosen as the standard platform for building our future modular control and data acquisition systems. We are currently developing two CompactPCI-Serial FPGA boards: FMC+ carrier and the COM-I/O. Both cards use the same family of Xilinx MPSoC (Zynq UltraScale+) as their processing building block. Combination of these two boards",
        "together with COTS hardware should provide our system architects with enough flexibility to build systems with required budget and performance (high-end and/or low-cost) for various applications. We report on the state of the current challenging developments and describe system architectures for building high performance control and data acquisition systems using our hardware toolbox."

The DB features two 4.6 Gbps downlinks and two pairs of 9.6 Gbps uplinks powered by four SFP+ Optical transceivers. The downlinks receive configuration commands and LHC timing to be propagated to the front-end",

        "Xilinx Soft Error Mitigation and Triple Mode Redundancy are used. Reliability in the high speed links is achieve by adopting Cyclic Redundancy Check in the uplinks and Forward Error Correction in the downlinks. The DB features a dedicated Single Event Latch-up protection circuitry that power-cycles the board in the case of any over-current event avoiding any possible hardware damages. We present a summary of the studies performed to verify the reliability if the performance of the DB revision 6",
