        "Software integration of diverse data acquisition and timing hardware devices in diagnostics applications is very challenging. While the implementation should manage multiple hardware devices from different manufacturers providing different applications program interfaces (APIs)",

        "combining functions of the different low-level devices and collecting all system-specific logic",
