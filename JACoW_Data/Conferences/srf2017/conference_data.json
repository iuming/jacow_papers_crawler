One of the key technologies is CW superconducting cavities to realize the energy recovery of high beam current of more than 10 mA by suppressing HOMs and high gradient acceleration of higher than 12 MV/m. This CW superconducting cavity had been developed through the construction of the Compact ERL facility in KEK and it successfully achieved the energy recovery of 1 mA CW beam until now.

Such a system should be capable to store \"standard\" (some 10 ps long) and \"short\" (ps and sub-ps long) pulses simultaneously in the storage ring opening the door to picosecond dynamic and high-resolution experiments at the same facility. This unique feature can be created by the introduction of the beating effects produced by higher harmonic SRF cavity systems (1.5 GHz & 1.75 GHz). The challenging design specifications as well as the technological demands on the SRF system make BESSY VSR a defiant project where non-standard techniques such as waveguide-damped cavities have been further developed. This talk focuses on the new SRF developments that includes wveguide-damped cavities",

          "abstract": "The European Spallation Source (ESS) is currently under construction in Lund, Sweden. The ESS linear accelerator aims to deliver a 62.5 mA , 2.86 ms long proton beam onto a rotating tungsten target, at 14 Hz repetition rate, thus achieving an energy of 2 GeV and 5 MW power. Most of the beam acceleration happens in the superconducting fraction of the linac, which is composed of three sectors of cryomodules named after the cavities housed within. The first sector of the SRF linac is composed of 13 Spoke cryomodules containing 2 double-spoke cavities with a geometric beta of 0.5, the second is composed of 9 medium beta cryomodules each housing four elliptical cavities (β=0.67) and finally 21 high beta cryomodules enclosing four elliptical cavities (β=0.86). ESS has strategically built up a SRF collaboration with other European institutions, these partners will deliver through In-Kind agreements cavities and cryomodules performing within the ESS specification. This article describes the process leading to the acceptance of cavities and cryomodules received from the different partners and the necessary testing required prior to the final installation in the ESS tunnel. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

A superconducting linac based on the half-wave resonator is studied in order to increase the proton energy from 100 MeV to 160 MeV for secondary particle generation such as neutron. A cryomodule and its cryogenics were designed. The operating temperature of the HWR is 2 K. One cryomodule contains four HWR cavities and it didn't have superconducting solenoid because a doublet lattice using normal conducting magnet was considered as focusing elements. A thermal design was conducted and the structure was designed based on the existing well proven technologies. The results of the design on the cryomodule and cryogenics for KOMAC HWR are summarized and discussed in the conference. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

            "Compact SRF Crab Cavities are integral to the HL-LHC upgrade. This paper details the design of support structures within the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) Crab Cavity Cryomodule. For ease of alignment each cavity is supported with the mechanical tuner and RF Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) via a common support plate. To reduce heat leak and remove bellows in the FPC it was determined that this would be the fixed support for the cavity (V. Parma",
            "2013). In addition",
            "novel flexural blades were designed to give increased stiffness yet allow for thermal contraction of the cavity towards the fixed point of the FPC. This approach was superior when compared via simulation to several alternative techniques. A detailed simulation model was used for optimisation of directional stiffness",
            "identification of vibration modes and minimising thermal stresses. A transmission matrix was developed in MS Excel to assess modal deflection for given ground vibration conditions. The spreadsheet gives an instantaneous yet comparable result to time consuming random vibration FE Analyses.

The prototype LCLS-II CM (pCM) was driven 750 miles to test the transport system; shock loggers recorded the shock attenuation on the pCM and vacuum gauges were used to detect any compromises in beamline vacuum. Alignment measurements were taken before and after the trip to check whether cavity positions had shifted beyond the ± 0.2mm spec. Passband frequencies and cavity gradients were measured at 2K at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) at JLab to identify any degradation of CM performance after transportation.

We studied the nitrogen doping effect through a series of experiments on niobium samples at both room and low temperature circumstances to seek the physical explanation based on the proposed nitrogen-hydrogen interaction. The time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) revealed that the diffused nitrogen plays a key role in the nitrogen doping effect. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed the chemical distribution of it. The effects of different concentrations of diffused nitrogen on the samples' magnetic property were studied by the magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). Direct observation of the surface topography of both doped and undoped samples by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) at liquid nitrogen temperature has proved that the diffused nitrogen can prevent or retard the hydrides formation to varying degrees with different amounts of material removal. A possible mechanism of nitrogen-doping effect is proposed based on our study."

Our work relates to exploring microstructure correlations relevant to the above topics using coupon SRF Nb samples. Of particular importance are: a) hydride precipitation which could occur during cavity cooling below cryogenic temperatures, b) variation in surface superconducting properties and N doping, c) extent of surface damage in as received Nb sheets, and d) distribution of dislocation and substructures which lead to lattice strains in the material. The main results of our studies suggest the role of GB's in hydride formation, direct evidence of N doping preventing hydrides, and occurrence of strained lattice features depending on the surface treatment of SRF Nb. We also look at how this type of study can supplement and strengthen the effort to include quantitative microstructure based features in our understanding, and modelling of SRF superconductivity in Nb.",

The cavities suffer from trips with a sudden loss of accelerating field if operated above a certain voltage. Consequently the cavities are operated at voltages up to 1.4 MV for better reliability. These cavities are iris coupled and have fixed Qext. At these lower operating voltages",

The 3 stub tuner further enhances this standing wave. Numerical simulation reveals that the standing wave field from the cavity penetrates into the coupling waveguide increasing the probability of multipactor and breakdown in the coupler region. The results of multipactor simulations in this region with CST Studio are discussed."

For pulsed operation",

All deformations resulting from any type of external loads on cavity walls lead to shifts in the working RF frequency in the range of hundreds of kHz. Taking into account high Q-factor of SC cavities such a large frequency shift takes the cavity out of operation. Here we present and discuss the achievements and problems of microphonics passive damping in different type SRF cavities."

We have systematically coated niobium with Nb3Sn using \"vapor diffusion\" under varying coating conditions to elucidate the reaction of tin with niobium at the temperatures of interest. The analysis of the coated samples is revealing new understanding about the two-stage nucleation/deposition (\"vapor diffusion\") process that allows us to form a hypothesis regarding Nb3Sn formation mechanism. The essential aspect of nucleation is the deposition of a high coverage",

One of them is the development and commissioning of a 9-cell scale HF free Bipolar Electro-Polishing (BEP) system. Faraday Technology had completed the proof of principle on BEP with single cell scale prior to the work reported here, and has now developed a new 9-cell scale BEP system. Cornell has fabricated three single cell cavities and has assembled them together as a 9-cell scale test string. The 9-cell scale test string has received BEP at Faraday Technology and RF testing has been performed on the three single cell cavities one-by-one at Cornell. Here we give a status update on the new 9-cell scale BEP system commissioning and on results from RF tests of the BEP cavities. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

The design of the cathode for VEP of a 9-cell cavity was based on the Ninja cathode used for 1-cell cavity since the 1-cell Ninja cathode was found effective to reduce longitudinal asymmetry in material removal and to obtain a smooth surface of a 1-cell cavity. Moreover",
            "1-cell Nb cavities after being treated in VEP using the Ninja cathode showed good performance in vertical RF tests. The 9-cell coupon cavity used in this study was designed to have totally nine coupons set on the iris and equator positions of the first",
            "fifth and ninth cells. These three cells contain viewports as well at their upper and lower iris positions. Measurement of currents from the individual coupons and in-situ observation are possible using the cavity to understand EP phenomenon at different locations of the cavity. VEP results",
            "which include removal thicknesses at different positions of the cavity and surface study of the coupons",

            "The compact SRF Crab Cavities required for HL-LHC have complex geometries making prediction of average and local BCP etch rates a difficult task. This paper describes a series of experiments and simulations used to determine the etch uniformity and rate within these structures. An initial experiment was conducted to determine the correlation between etch rate and flow rate in a Nb tube. These results were then incorporated into Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of acid flow in the Double Quarter Wave (DQW) cavity to predict etch rates across the surface and allow optimisation of the BCP setup. There were several important findings from the work; one of which is that the flow rate in the relatively large body of the cavity is predominantly driven by natural convection due to the exothermic reaction. During BCP processing of the DQW cavity a significant difference in etching was observed between upper and lower horizontal surfaces which was mitigated by etching in several orientations. Two DQW cavities manufactured by CERN have received a heavy BCP of 200μm followed by 2 light BCPs of 30μm each with subsequent vertical cold tests showing performance exceeding specification."

          "abstract": "Niobium thin films were deposited onto a-plane sapphire with varying kinetic energy and varying substrate temperature. There were no consistent trends which related the particle energy or substrate temperature to RRR. The sample which displayed the largest RRR of 229 was then compared to both a thin film deposited with similar conditions onto copper substrate and to bulk niobium. DC magnetometry measurements suggest that the mechanism of flux entry into thin film niobium and bulk niobium may vary due to differences in the volumes of both defects and impurities located within the grains. Results also suggest that magnetic flux may penetrate thin films at small fields due to the sample geometry. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

Jefferson Lab has recently initiated a standardized particulate sampling and characterization practice in order to gain more systematic knowledge of the particulates actually present. It is expected that patterns that emerge from such sampling will strengthen source attribution and guide improvement efforts. Initial samples were gathered from a cryomodule and adjoining warm girders removed from the CEBAF tunnel for reprocessing. The collection and analysis techniques were also used to characterize particulates on the inside of LCLS-II string components. Samples are transferred to clean industry-standard forensic GSR carbon tape spindles and examined via automated cleanroom SEM scanning for particle localization and sizing. The particulates are subsequently analyzed with EDS for elemental composition. A catalogue of particle types is being accumulated. The methods used and results obtained from these initial applications will be presented."

More recently the option of using a bilayer system of two superconductors has been considered as an alternative approach to reach accelerating gradients beyond bulk niobium or to explain the gradient enhancement from a 120°C bake by introduction of a 'dirty layer \"**\"'. In this talk results are presented from two muon spin rotation experiments at TRIUMF and PSI. The former measures the field of first entry Hentry. It will be shown that MgB2 and Nb3Sn on top of Nb both push Hentry above Hc1 to a value consistent with Hsh",

Using the low energy muon beam at PSI we show that there is a long range proximity effect in a bilayer system of NbTiN on Nb. This effect yields a stronger decay of the RF field with depth as expected for pure NbTiN",

The cavities have been manufactured by Research Instruments GmbH and Ettore Zanon S.p.a. and represent the first industrially produced nitrogen-doped cavities. Here the results from the vertical tests of the cavities received so far are presented. First results show that nitrogen-doping leads to the highest Q0 values achieved in SRF cavities produced for a large-scale project. This has been not without challenges however, and we discuss new findings with regards to flux expulsion, intrinsic residual resistance, and cavity preparation techniques that limited cavity performance in the beginning of production. These new findings and material studies are important for future accelerators so that high Q0 performance can be reliably achieved for large projects."

Several studies investigated how the ambient magnetic field can be minimized or how the flux expulsion during the phase transition can be improved. We now present a study that targets the pinning centers which allow for the flux to remain inside the superconductor in the first place. Using magneto-optical imaging we were able to not only measure the amount of trapped flux but in addition we managed to image its distribution with a resolution below 10μm and correlate it with electron backscatter diffraction maps. As a result we found that the grain boundaries did not play a major role as pinning centers nor did the crystal orientation influence the amount of trapped flux signifi-cantly. Niobium hydrides which formed during the cool down to cryogenic temperatures however were found to enhance trapping. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

            "Current state-of-the-art Niobium superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerator cavities have reached surface magnetic field close to the theoretical maximum set by the superheating field. Further increasing accelerating gradients will require new superconducting materials for accelerator cavities that are capable of supporting higher surface magnetic fields. This necessitates measuring the quench fields of new materials in high power RF fields. Previous work at Cornell University has used electromagnetic simulations to optimize the shape of a dipole mode sample host cavity such that the surface magnetic fields on the sample are high compared to the energy inside the cavity and the surface magnetic field on the rest of the cavity. In this paper we present an update of the design that includes how to mount samples in the cavity and the addition of a low field chamber."

In order to improve this behaviour one approach which has been proposed is to replace the single cathode with a double cathode and test the suitability of different deposition techniques. With this change it is possible to control the plasma and power distribution separately for the inner and outer part of cavity and thereby potentially improve film uniformity throughout the cavity and coating duration.

            "The thermal conductivity of Niobium (Nb) often experiences a local maximum (a phonon peak) at a temperature between 1.8 and 3 K. While the magnitude of the phonon peak has been shown to be related to the dislocation density and may be influenced by manufacturing processes",
            "little has been discussed as to the temperature at which the peak occurs. In examining these phenomena",
            "it has been determined that more explicit accounting of phonon–dislocation scattering in a popular model better represents the thermal conductivity at temperatures colder than 3 K. Scaled sensitivity coefficients show this term to have similar influence as the phonon-electron and phonon-boundary scattering terms. Results using the enhanced model also show an apparent threshold of dislocation density below which there is little contribution to the thermal conductivity of Nb."

            "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is an SRF accelerator project in full production at Michigan State University (MSU). With the civil construction nearly complete, the installation of accelerator equipment into the tunnel has taken center stage. A total of 46 superconducting cryomodules are needed for the FRIB linac to reach 200 MeV per nucleon. The linac consist of four cavity types (β = 0.041, 0.085, 0.29, and 0.53) and 6 different cryomodule designs. Cryomodule assembly is done in 5 parallel bays, each one compatible with every cryomodule type. Completed cryomodules undergo full system testing in bunkers before being accepted and delivered to the tunnel. The current status of the cryomodule assembly effort will be presented, including lessons learned and overall experience to date."

Such a system should be capable to store \"standard\" (some 10 ps long) and \"short\" (ps and sub-ps long) pulses simultaneously in the storage ring opening the door to picosecond dynamic and high-resolution experiments at the same facility. This unique feature can be created by the introduction of the beating effects produced by higher harmonic SRF cavity systems (1.5 GHz & 1.75 GHz). The challenging design specifications as well as the technological demands on the SRF system make BESSY VSR a defiant project where non-standard techniques such as waveguide-damped cavities have been further developed.

The ESS linear accelerator aims to deliver a 62.5 mA , 2.86 ms long proton beam onto a rotating tungsten target, at 14 Hz repetition rate, thus achieving an energy of 2 GeV and 5 MW power. Most of the beam acceleration happens in the superconducting fraction of the linac, which is composed of three sectors of cryomodules named after the cavities housed within. The first sector of the SRF linac is composed of 13 Spoke cryomodules containing 2 double-spoke cavities with a geometric beta of 0.5, the second is composed of 9 medium beta cryomodules each housing four elliptical cavities (β=0.67) and finally 21 high beta cryomodules enclosing four elliptical cavities (β=0.86). ESS has strategically built up a SRF collaboration with other European institutions, these partners will deliver through In-Kind agreements cavities and cryomodules performing within the ESS specification. This article describes the process leading to the acceptance of cavities and cryomodules received from the different partners and the necessary testing required prior to the final installation in the ESS tunnel. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

The coupler is designed to handle 100 kW CW power of 325 MHz and is currently being fabricated. T-bend transition and doorknob have been taken into account. The length of the T-bend short circuit is sensitive to S parameters and contributes to the online adjustment of VSWR in RF conditioning.

One cryomodule contains four HWR cavities and it didn't have superconducting solenoid because a doublet lattice using normal conducting magnet was considered as focusing elements. A thermal design was conducted and the structure was designed based on the existing well proven technologies. The results of the design on the cryomodule and cryogenics for KOMAC HWR are summarized and discussed in the conference. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

        "Compact SRF Crab Cavities are integral to the HL-LHC upgrade. This paper details the design of support structures within the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) Crab Cavity Cryomodule. For ease of alignment each cavity is supported with the mechanical tuner and RF Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) via a common support plate. To reduce heat leak and remove bellows in the FPC it was determined that this would be the fixed support for the cavity (V. Parma",
        "2013). In addition",
        "novel flexural blades were designed to give increased stiffness yet allow for thermal contraction of the cavity towards the fixed point of the FPC. This approach was superior when compared via simulation to several alternative techniques. A detailed simulation model was used for optimisation of directional stiffness",
        "identification of vibration modes and minimising thermal stresses. A transmission matrix was developed in MS Excel to assess modal deflection for given ground vibration conditions. The spreadsheet gives an instantaneous yet comparable result to time consuming random vibration FE Analyses. The final engineering design of the supporting system is now complete and will also be described in this paper.",

Alignment measurements were taken before and after the trip to check whether cavity positions had shifted beyond the ± 0.2mm spec. Passband frequencies and cavity gradients were measured at 2K at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) at JLab to identify any degradation of CM performance after transportation.

We studied the nitrogen doping effect through a series of experiments on niobium samples at both room and low temperature circumstances to seek the physical explanation based on the proposed nitrogen-hydrogen interaction. The time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) revealed that the diffused nitrogen plays a key role in the nitrogen doping effect. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements showed the chemical distribution of it. The effects of different concentrations of diffused nitrogen on the samples' magnetic property were studied by the magnetic property measurement system (MPMS). Direct observation of the surface topography of both doped and undoped samples by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) at liquid nitrogen temperature has proved that the diffused nitrogen can prevent or retard the hydrides formation to varying degrees with different amounts of material removal. A possible mechanism of nitrogen-doping effect is proposed based on our study."

Our work relates to exploring microstructure correlations relevant to the above topics using coupon SRF Nb samples. Of particular importance are: a) hydride precipitation which could occur during cavity cooling below cryogenic temperatures, b) variation in surface superconducting properties and N doping, c) extent of surface damage in as received Nb sheets, and d) distribution of dislocation and substructures which lead to lattice strains in the material. The main results of our studies suggest the role of GB's in hydride formation, direct evidence of N doping preventing hydrides, and occurrence of strained lattice features depending on the surface treatment of SRF Nb. We also look at how this type of study can supplement and strengthen the effort to include quantitative microstructure based features in our understanding, and modelling of SRF superconductivity in Nb.",

The cavities suffer from trips with a sudden loss of accelerating field if operated above a certain voltage. Consequently the cavities are operated at voltages up to 1.4 MV for better reliability. These cavities are iris coupled and have fixed Qext. At these lower operating voltages",

        "the step due to the difference in the height of the coupling waveguide on the cavity and that of the vacuum side waveguide on the window results in a standing wave between the cavity and the window even at matched operation. The 3 stub tuner further enhances this standing wave. Numerical simulation reveals that the standing wave field from the cavity penetrates into the coupling waveguide increasing the probability of multipactor and breakdown in the coupler region. The results of multipactor simulations in this region with CST Studio are discussed."

The most important of them are very high electromagnetic fields that result in strong Lorentz forces and the pressure on cavity walls from the helium tank that also deforms the cavity shape. For pulsed operation",
        "the Lorentz forces usually play the decisive role for the cavity design. For CW operation",

All deformations resulting from any type of external loads on cavity walls lead to shifts in the working RF frequency in the range of hundreds of kHz. Taking into account high Q-factor of SC cavities such a large frequency shift takes the cavity out of operation. Here we present and discuss the achievements and problems of microphonics passive damping in different type SRF cavities."

This necessitates precise tuning and therefore good compensation of microphonics and coupled Lorentz-force detuning driven instabilities. Here we present a conceptual study of an integrated SRF resonator and helium vessel structure design to ensure a reduced resonance frequency dependence on pressure and Lorentz forces to minimize their impact on the accelerating field profile."

Faraday Technology had completed the proof of principle on BEP with single cell scale prior to the work reported here, and has now developed a new 9-cell scale BEP system. Cornell has fabricated three single cell cavities and has assembled them together as a 9-cell scale test string. The 9-cell scale test string has received BEP at Faraday Technology and RF testing has been performed on the three single cell cavities one-by-one at Cornell.

It has three accelerating modules with 8 Quarter Wave Resonators (QWR)in each. The QWRs for the first module were built at Argonne National Laboratory while those for the second and third modules have been built in-house. During the electropolishing of one of the indigenously built resonators (QWR # I03) the RF surface got spoiled due to a wrong acid mixture that was being used for etching. In subsequent cold tests of the cavity",
        "its performance was poor (2.6 MV/m @ 4W). There was evidence of Q disease also",

        "a substantial improvement (factor of two) in the performance was observed. Encouraged with the results another QWR designed for a lower beta (β=0.05) was also heat treated identically. This paper presents the different treatments followed to enhance the cavity performance vis-à-vis the test results."

With accelerating fields on the order of wet etching processes and a decrease in field emission the use of plasma assisted etching for bulk Nb processing is a worthwhile endeavor. We are presenting the surface properties of plasma etched Nb. Cavity grade Nb coupons were made by water jet cutting",

        "The compact SRF Crab Cavities required for HL-LHC have complex geometries making prediction of average and local BCP etch rates a difficult task. This paper describes a series of experiments and simulations used to determine the etch uniformity and rate within these structures. An initial experiment was conducted to determine the correlation between etch rate and flow rate in a Nb tube. These results were then incorporated into Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations of acid flow in the Double Quarter Wave (DQW) cavity to predict etch rates across the surface and allow optimisation of the BCP setup. There were several important findings from the work; one of which is that the flow rate in the relatively large body of the cavity is predominantly driven by natural convection due to the exothermic reaction. During BCP processing of the DQW cavity a significant difference in etching was observed between upper and lower horizontal surfaces which was mitigated by etching in several orientations. Two DQW cavities manufactured by CERN have received a heavy BCP of 200μm followed by 2 light BCPs of 30μm each with subsequent vertical cold tests showing performance exceeding specification."

      "abstract": "Niobium thin films were deposited onto a-plane sapphire with varying kinetic energy and varying substrate temperature. There were no consistent trends which related the particle energy or substrate temperature to RRR. The sample which displayed the largest RRR of 229 was then compared to both a thin film deposited with similar conditions onto copper substrate and to bulk niobium. DC magnetometry measurements suggest that the mechanism of flux entry into thin film niobium and bulk niobium may vary due to differences in the volumes of both defects and impurities located within the grains. Results also suggest that magnetic flux may penetrate thin films at small fields due to the sample geometry. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

Jefferson Lab has recently initiated a standardized particulate sampling and characterization practice in order to gain more systematic knowledge of the particulates actually present. It is expected that patterns that emerge from such sampling will strengthen source attribution and guide improvement efforts. Initial samples were gathered from a cryomodule and adjoining warm girders removed from the CEBAF tunnel for reprocessing. The collection and analysis techniques were also used to characterize particulates on the inside of LCLS-II string components. Samples are transferred to clean industry-standard forensic GSR carbon tape spindles and examined via automated cleanroom SEM scanning for particle localization and sizing. The particulates are subsequently analyzed with EDS for elemental composition. A catalogue of particle types is being accumulated. The methods used and results obtained from these initial applications will be presented."

        "The multilayer approach is being investigated for SRF applications since 2006 \"*\". More recently the option of using a bilayer system of two superconductors has been considered as an alternative approach to reach accelerating gradients beyond bulk niobium or to explain the gradient enhancement from a 120°C bake by introduction of a 'dirty layer \"**\"'. In this talk results are presented from two muon spin rotation experiments at TRIUMF and PSI. The former measures the field of first entry Hentry. It will be shown that MgB2 and Nb3Sn on top of Nb both push Hentry above Hc1 to a value consistent with Hsh",
        "independent of the layer thickness. 120°C baking increases Hentry slightly but significantly above Hc1. Using the low energy muon beam at PSI we show that there is a long range proximity effect in a bilayer system of NbTiN on Nb. This effect yields a stronger decay of the RF field with depth as expected for pure NbTiN",

Zhang in SRF15. Although the best cavity performance can be achieved by careful cool down",

The cavities have been manufactured by Research Instruments GmbH and Ettore Zanon S.p.a. and represent the first industrially produced nitrogen-doped cavities. Here the results from the vertical tests of the cavities received so far are presented. First results show that nitrogen-doping leads to the highest Q0 values achieved in SRF cavities produced for a large-scale project. This has been not without challenges however, and we discuss new findings with regards to flux expulsion, intrinsic residual resistance, and cavity preparation techniques that limited cavity performance in the beginning of production. These new findings and material studies are important for future accelerators so that high Q0 performance can be reliably achieved for large projects."

      "abstract": "Over the past years trapped magnetic flux has emerged as a main limiting factor of high quality factors in SRF cavities. Several studies investigated how the ambient magnetic field can be minimized or how the flux expulsion during the phase transition can be improved. We now present a study that targets the pinning centers which allow for the flux to remain inside the superconductor in the first place. Using magneto-optical imaging we were able to not only measure the amount of trapped flux but in addition we managed to image its distribution with a resolution below 10μm and correlate it with electron backscatter diffraction maps. As a result we found that the grain boundaries did not play a major role as pinning centers nor did the crystal orientation influence the amount of trapped flux signifi-cantly. Niobium hydrides which formed during the cool down to cryogenic temperatures however were found to enhance trapping. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

Reducing surface roughness of Nb3Sn surfaces may be necessary to achieve higher gradient accelerator cavities with high Q. Previous work at Cornell has shown the impact of several chemical treatments on the surface roughness of Nb3Sn films; however",

        "Current state-of-the-art Niobium superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) accelerator cavities have reached surface magnetic field close to the theoretical maximum set by the superheating field. Further increasing accelerating gradients will require new superconducting materials for accelerator cavities that are capable of supporting higher surface magnetic fields. This necessitates measuring the quench fields of new materials in high power RF fields. Previous work at Cornell University has used electromagnetic simulations to optimize the shape of a dipole mode sample host cavity such that the surface magnetic fields on the sample are high compared to the energy inside the cavity and the surface magnetic field on the rest of the cavity. In this paper we present an update of the design that includes how to mount samples in the cavity and the addition of a low field chamber."

With this change it is possible to control the plasma and power distribution separately for the inner and outer part of cavity and thereby potentially improve film uniformity throughout the cavity and coating duration.

Results using the enhanced model also show an apparent threshold of dislocation density below which there is little contribution to the thermal conductivity of Nb."

A thin layer of normalconducting hexagonal niobium nitride (NbN) forms at the surface which is removed by electropolishing while the higher quality factors are attributed to the N2 diffusion into the bulk Nb. At temperatures from 1300°C to 1700°C a thin layer of the superconducting cubic phase of NbN can be observed",

The new design uses innovative nitrogen doped cavities together with a helium vessel that provides high thermal gradient on the cavities during a fast cool down. Magnetic shielding uses two layers outside of helium vessel and a single layer that completely encapsulates the end groups except the beam apertures. Sophisticated magnetic hygiene includes vacuum vessel demagnetization",
        "magnetic screening of the components and final demagnetization to the assembled cryomodule. Fermilab successfully assembled a preproduction LCLS-II cryomodule that achieved unprecedented cavity quality factors of 3.0·1010 at a nominal cryomodule voltage. The ambient fields in the cavities were near zero. This article describes historic cavity performance under various cool down parameters. Cavity performance retained very well compared to that of vertical tests."
