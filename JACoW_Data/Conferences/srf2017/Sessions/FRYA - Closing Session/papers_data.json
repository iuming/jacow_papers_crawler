        "which is long refueling period (~30yrs) fast core and initialed by accelerator driven. Since the higher controllable reactivity",
        "the 'raw' recycle fuel (>50% Fission Products) could be used inside ADB. Therefore",
        "ADANES is the ideal close fuel cycle for utilizing fissile fuel 95% and minimizing radiotoxicity <4% with live time <500 yr. In this approaches",
        "the SCL play ADB's starter (<15% duration) which could drive ~10 set of the fast reactor. So far",
        "the key technical R&D make a significant breakthrough. Two injector (325/162.5 MHz) have extracted ~10 MeV/1.1~2.7 mA CW proton beam and the integral SCL has extracted ~25 MeV beam. The new concept of the granular target is made of fluid solid grain in mm and driven by gravity",
        "which power could increase to 10~100 MW. Next phase ADANES will start soon which include ADB power ~2.5 MW@500MeV proton SCL; ADRUF's compact neutron source driven by <250 MeV/5mA deuteron SCL."
