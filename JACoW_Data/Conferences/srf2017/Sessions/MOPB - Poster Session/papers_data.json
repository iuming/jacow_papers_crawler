In addition to the surface inspection by OBACHT a new optical inspection system with integrated high resolution camera is set up at DESY. It allows inspection of multi-cell resonators as well as gun cavity resonators with only single side accessibility to the inner surface. A prototype was commissioned and optical inspections were done with OBACHT and the new system in parallel. Two SRF gun cavities were inspected by this optical system and origin of limitations of the resonators were identified."

The ESS linear accelerator aims to deliver a 62.5 mA , 2.86 ms long proton beam onto a rotating tungsten target, at 14 Hz repetition rate, thus achieving an energy of 2 GeV and 5 MW power. Most of the beam acceleration happens in the superconducting fraction of the linac, which is composed of three sectors of cryomodules named after the cavities housed within. The first sector of the SRF linac is composed of 13 Spoke cryomodules containing 2 double-spoke cavities with a geometric beta of 0.5, the second is composed of 9 medium beta cryomodules each housing four elliptical cavities (β=0.67) and finally 21 high beta cryomodules enclosing four elliptical cavities (β=0.86). ESS has strategically built up a SRF collaboration with other European institutions, these partners will deliver through In-Kind agreements cavities and cryomodules performing within the ESS specification. This article describes the process leading to the acceptance of cavities and cryomodules received from the different partners and the necessary testing required prior to the final installation in the ESS tunnel. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

The original CEBAF HOM and FPC end groups are retained. The goal is to achieve up to 75 MV (18.75 MV/m) for the reworked module ('C75').

The length of the T-bend short circuit is sensitive to S parameters and contributes to the online adjustment of VSWR in RF conditioning. The doorknob type is adopted to realize the transition from a half-height WR 2300 waveguide to a coaxial line ended with a coupling antenna. This paper describes the RF design",

A cryomodule and its cryogenics were designed. The operating temperature of the HWR is 2 K. One cryomodule contains four HWR cavities and it didn't have superconducting solenoid because a doublet lattice using normal conducting magnet was considered as focusing elements. A thermal design was conducted and the structure was designed based on the existing well proven technologies. The results of the design on the cryomodule and cryogenics for KOMAC HWR are summarized and discussed in the conference. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2017-",

For ease of alignment each cavity is supported with the mechanical tuner and RF Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) via a common support plate. To reduce heat leak and remove bellows in the FPC it was determined that this would be the fixed support for the cavity (V. Parma",
        "2013). In addition",
        "novel flexural blades were designed to give increased stiffness yet allow for thermal contraction of the cavity towards the fixed point of the FPC. This approach was superior when compared via simulation to several alternative techniques. A detailed simulation model was used for optimisation of directional stiffness",
        "identification of vibration modes and minimising thermal stresses. A transmission matrix was developed in MS Excel to assess modal deflection for given ground vibration conditions. The spreadsheet gives an instantaneous yet comparable result to time consuming random vibration FE Analyses. The final engineering design of the supporting system is now complete and will also be described in this paper.",
