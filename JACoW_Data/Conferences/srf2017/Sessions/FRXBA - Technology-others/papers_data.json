Hardware and software implementing a digital LLRF system has been constructed by a four-lab collaboration to minimize known contributors to cavity RF field fluctuation. Efforts include careful attachment to the phase reference line",
        "and minimizing the effects of RF crosstalk by placing forward and reverse signals in chassis separate from the cavity measurement. A low-noise receiver/digitizer section will allow feedback to operate with high proportional gain without excessive noise being sent to the drive amplifier. Test results will show behavior on prototype cryomodules at FNAL and JLab",
