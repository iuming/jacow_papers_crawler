        "The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is an SRF accelerator project in full production at Michigan State University (MSU). With the civil construction nearly complete, the installation of accelerator equipment into the tunnel has taken center stage. A total of 46 superconducting cryomodules are needed for the FRIB linac to reach 200 MeV per nucleon. The linac consist of four cavity types (β = 0.041, 0.085, 0.29, and 0.53) and 6 different cryomodule designs. Cryomodule assembly is done in 5 parallel bays, each one compatible with every cryomodule type. Completed cryomodules undergo full system testing in bunkers before being accepted and delivered to the tunnel. The current status of the cryomodule assembly effort will be presented, including lessons learned and overall experience to date."

This novel cryomodule is the first SRF module ever to be fully optimized simultaneously for high efficient SRF cavity operation and for supporting very high CW beam currents. After a successful initial MLC testing",
        "the MLC has now been moved into its final location for the CBETA ring. For a first beam test of the MLC and CBETA",
        "the Cornell ERL high voltage DC gun and SRF injector cryomodule were connected to MLC via an entry beam line; a beam stop assembly was also installed at the exit line. In this paper",
        "we summarize the performance of this novel ERL cryomodule including the results of the first beam test and the additional tests focused on RF field stability and cavity microphonics."

        "Continuous wave (CW) operation of LCLS-II cryomodules require substantial design changes to previously designed 1.3 GHz ILC type cryomodule. The new design uses innovative nitrogen doped cavities together with a helium vessel that provides high thermal gradient on the cavities during a fast cool down. Magnetic shielding uses two layers outside of helium vessel and a single layer that completely encapsulates the end groups except the beam apertures. Sophisticated magnetic hygiene includes vacuum vessel demagnetization",
        "magnetic screening of the components and final demagnetization to the assembled cryomodule. Fermilab successfully assembled a preproduction LCLS-II cryomodule that achieved unprecedented cavity quality factors of 3.0·1010 at a nominal cryomodule voltage. The ambient fields in the cavities were near zero. This article describes historic cavity performance under various cool down parameters. Cavity performance retained very well compared to that of vertical tests."
