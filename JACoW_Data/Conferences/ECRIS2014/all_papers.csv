ECRIS2014,,MOOMMH01,How Can an ECRIS Meet Requirement of the Next Generation Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility,H.W. Zhao; L.T. Sun; IMP; Lanzhou; People's Republic of China; Driven by the requirement of nuclear physics research; a few next generation heavy ion accelerator facilities have been proposed such as GSI-FAIR; IMP-HIAF; JINR-NICA and JLAB-MEIC which require ion source to produce very intense pulsed-highly-charged heavy ion beams such as Au32+; U28+ and U35+ with beam current 1011 particles per pulse. With more intense higher charge state heavy ion beam produced; the design and building of such a heavy ion accelerator complex will be more cost effective and more compact. This is a big challenge and also an opportunity for ECR ion source development. However; how can an ECR ion source compete with other ion sources such as EBIS; LIS and MEVVA ion sources to meet requirement of the next generation heavy ion accelerator complex? The potential performance of the next generation ECRISs working at the frequency 40~60 GHz and comparison with other possible ion sources will be presented. This paper will have a detailed discussion of the foreseen challenges of the next generation ECRISs and impact on the next generation heavy ion acclerator complex as well.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/moommh01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/moommh01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/moommh01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOMMH01,

The particularity of such a prototype is the establishing of a topologically closed ECR zone in a cusp configuration. During the current increase to get a closed 60 GHz zone; a failure appeared at 21000 A in one helix among the four. After the modification of the cooling circuit; the prototype was able to accept up to 26000 A allowing high frequency experiments. In the same time; a 60 GHz - 300 kW pulsed gyrotron has been successfully built and installed in Grenoble by IAP-RAS and Gycom company. The first 60 GHz ECR plasma has been produced in April 2014; the first pulsed beams have been extracted and analyzed. The experimental results obtained will be presented along with the perspectives of such developments.,"Funding: We acknowledge the support of the LNCMI-CNRS, member of the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL) and the International Science and Technology Center (project#3965).",,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/moommh02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/moommh02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/moommh02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOMMH02,
ECRIS2014,,MOOMMH03,First Results At 24 GHz With The Superconducting Source For Ions (SuSI),G. Machicoane; D.G. Cole; D.E. Neben; L. Tobos; NSCL; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; K. Holland; D. Leitner; D. Morris; FRIB; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; The superconducting ECR ion source SuSI at Michigan State University was designed to operate primarily at 18GHz and has demonstrated very good performance at this frequency especially when coupling two klystrons to the plasma [1]. Following a period of training; SuSI has been able to reach the magnetic field needed for operation in the high-B mode at 24 GHz. SuSI has several interesting features. First the axial magnetic profile is defined using 6 solenoids which provide some flexibility to adjust parameters such as field gradient at the resonance; Bminimum or plasma length. Second with a diameter of only 101mm; SuSI plasma chamber has a nominal volume of about 3.5 l. Therefore; power density in excess of 2kW/l could be reach and lead potentially to new insight on the maximum performance achievable with an ECR. In January 2014; a 10 kW 24 GHz Gyrotron obtained from the Russian company GYCOM was commissioned at MSU on a dummy load and then connected to SuSI. We report here on the first measurements done with SuSI at 24 GHz.; * L.T. Sun; J. Brandon; D.G. Cole; M. Doleans; G. Machicoane; D. Morris; T. Ropponen; L.

ECRIS2014,,MOOBMH02,Emittance Measurements For RIKEN 28 GHz SC-ECRIS,Y. Higurashi; T. Nakagawa; J. Ohnishi; K. Ozeki; RIKEN Nishina Center; Wako; Japan; In 2013; the intense beams of highly charged uranium ion (180euA of U35+; 230euA of U33+) were extracted from RIKEN SC-ECRIS. Following the success; intense beam of U35+ ions was used for the RIBF experiment for 24 days without break. It is obvious that production of high-quality beam (smaller emittacne and good stability etc) is also important for RIKEN radio isotope beam factory (RIBF) project. For this reason; in 2014; we systematically measured the emittance and beam intensity of the highly charged uranium ions under various conditions (magnetic field configuration; extracted beam intensity; beam stability etc) to search the optimum condition. In these experiments; we observed that the emittnce size is strongly dependent on the magnetic field configuration; especially Bext. In this contribution; we present the effect of the various parameters (magnetic field configuration; extracted beam intensity; beam stability etc) of the SC-ECRIS on the beam intensity and emittance. We also discuss its mechanism in detail.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/moobmh02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/moobmh02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/moobmh02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOBMH02,10
ECRIS2014,,MOOBMH03,"Frequency Tuning Effect On The Bremsstrahlung Spectra, Beam Intensity And Shape In An ECR Ion Source",G.O. Rodrigues; D. Kanjilal; N. Kumar; K. Mal; Y. Mathur; IUAC; New Delhi; India; VECC; Kolkata; India; The effect of the frequency tuning on bremsstrahlung spectra; beam intensity and shape in the 10 GHz; Nanogan ECR ion source have been investigated. The main aim of this work was to study the effect on a lower frequency type of ECR source where the separation between various modes in the cavity is much larger. The warm and cold components of the electrons were observed to be directly correlated with the beam intensity enhancement in the case of Ar9+ but not so for O5+. However; the warm electron component was much smaller than the cold component. The beam shapes of O5+ measured as a function of frequency showed a strong variation without hollow beam formation. Due to the use of an octupole magnetic structure in the Nanogan ECR source; the quadrupolar structure of the ECR surface is modified with the frequency tuning. In general; we have observed a strong absorption of microwave power at various frequencies whenever the reflection co-efficient showed a minimum value and the effect was seen stronger for the higher charge states. Details of the measurements carried out on the bremsstrahlung spectra; beam intensity and shape are presented together with the results of simulations.; * Effect of frequency tuning on bremsstrahlung spectra; beam intensity; and shape in the 10 GHz NANOGAN electron cyclotron resonance ion source; Rev. Sci.Instrum. 85; 02A944 (2014),,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/moobmh03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/moobmh03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/moobmh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOBMH03,15
ECRIS2014,,MOOBMH04,Emission Spectroscopy Diagnostic of Plasma Inside 2.45 GHz ECR Ion Source at PKU,Y. Xu; J. Chen; J.E. Chen; Z.Y. Guo; S.X. Peng; H.T. Ren; J.F. Zhang; T. Zhang; J. Zhao; PKU; Beijing; People's Republic of China; Graduate University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing; People's Republic of China; The 2.45 GHz permanent magnet electron cyclotron resonance ion source (PMECR) at Peking University (PKU) can produce 100 mA H+; 40 mA H2+ and 20 mA H3+ under different conditions; but the physics processes and plasma characteristics within the discharge chamber are not very clear until now. Langmuir probe; laser detachment; absorption spectroscopy and optical emission spectroscopy are common approaches for diagnosing the plasma. Among those methods; optical emission spectroscopy is a simple in situ one without disturbing the plasma. To better understand the plasma producing processes; a new ion source with transparent quartz discharge chamber was designed at PKU so that plasma diagnostic can be performed through directly detecting the light generated within ECR zone by fiber optics. Collisional radiative (CR) model is utilized to calculate plasma parameters like electron density ne and electron temperature Te for non-equilibrium plasma in ECR ion source. The spectroscopy diagnosis platform has been constructed; and preliminary results will be presented in this paper.,Funding: This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11175009 and 91126004).,*Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

As part of this study; the ion beam extraction system of the CERN GTS-LHC 14.5 GHz Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) has been modelled with the ion optical code IBSimu. The simulations predict self-consistently the triangular and hollow beam structures which are often observed experimentally with ECRIS ion beams. The model is used to investigate the performance of the current extraction system and provides a basis for possible future improvements. In addition; the extraction simulation provides a more realistic representation of the initial beam properties for the beam transport simulations; which aim to identify the performance bottle necks along the Linac3 low energy beam transport. The results of beam extraction simulations with Pb and Ar ion beams from the GTS-LHC will be presented and compared with experimental observations.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/mooamh01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/mooamh01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/mooamh01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOAMH01,23

A. Koivisto; O.A. Tarvainen; JYFL; Jyväskylä; Finland; A.V. Maslennikova; A. Volovecky; Nizhny Novgorod State Medical Academy; Nizhny Novgorod; Russia; This paper presents the latest results of high current proton and deuteron beam production at SMIS 37 at the Institute of Applied Physics. In this experimental setup the plasma is created by 37.5 GHz gyrotron radiation with power up to 100 kW in a simple mirror trap. High microwave power and frequency allow sustaining higher density hydrogen plasma in comparison to conventional ECRIS's or microwave sources. The low ion temperature; on the order of a few eV; is beneficial to produce proton beams with low emittance. Latest experiments with hydrogen and deuterium show possibility of beam formation with currents up to 550 mA at high voltages below 45 kV with normalized rms emittance lower than 0.2 pi*mm*mrad. Such beams have a high potential for application in future accelerator research. Also in frames of the present paper it is suggested to use such an ion source in a scheme of D-D neutron generator. Such ion source can produce deuteron ion beams with current density up to 700-800 mA/cm2. Generation of the neutron flux with density at the level of 7-8*1010 s−1cm-2 could be obtained in case of TiD2 target bombardment with deuteron beam accelerated to 100 keV.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/mooamh02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/mooamh02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/mooamh02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOAMH02,30
ECRIS2014,,MOOAMH03,Optimization Of Low-Energy Beam Transport,H.R. Kremers; J.P.M. Beijers; S. Brandenburg; KVI; Groningen; The Netherlands; We have studied the extraction and transport of a low-energy ion beam between an Electron Cyclotron Resonance (ECR) Ion Source and the analyzing magnet. This first part of the transport line is particularly sensitive to emittance blowup caused by ion-optical aberrations and non-paraxiality of the beam. This can be prevented by an appropriate focussing element between ion source and analyzing magnet. We present the results of beam transport simulations for different focussing elements including an einzel lens; solenoid and quadrupole element. These calculations; verified by measurements; lead to a design of an optimal; low-energy beam transport line for ion beams with large beam divergences.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/mooamh03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/mooamh03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/mooamh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOAMH03,33

In this case the construction of the MHD stable non-axial symmetric magnetic systems becomes rather complicated. Thus; the search of axial symmetric magnetic systems with depressed transversal losses caused by MHD instabilities is in a great demand. In this report some of the possible versions of such magnetic systems are presented: cusp magnetic trap; system with magnetic divertor and the mirror trap with the differential rotation layer in plasmas. Perspectives of using these systems in the ECR ion sources according to the results of experimental investigations on SMIS 37 setup in Nizhny Novgorod are discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/mooamh04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/mooamh04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/mooamh04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOOAMH04,

Electrons and ions can move more freely only along the magnetic field line compared to the transverse direction. Extraction simulation requires that the trajectories of charged particles have to be traced through the plasma chamber. In previous simulations the particle density at the beginning of the trajectory deep inside the plasma has been unknown. Now the full 3D electron tracking within the plasma chamber has been combined with the generation of initial ion starting conditions including particle density for ion tracking. The TrapCAD code has been used to determine the electron spatial distribution in a certain energy window. The idea is that at the places where the electron reaches a specific energy; an ion trajectory can be started. The magnetic field has been modeled with OPERA.

Effective absorption of microwave power in the deuterium plasma ensures an intense ionization and hence optimum electron density and temperature. Optical emission spectroscopy is one of the diagnostic techniques used to measure parameters of produced ECR plasmas. In this paper; the effect of microwave power on electron temperature in deuterium plasma is investigated. The plasma was generated by 2.45 GHz ECR microwave source. The microwave power was varied from 100-400 Watt keeping the deuterium gas pressure in the range of ~ 5×10-4 mbar. The flow rate of gas was ~ 5×10-4sccm. Plasma was diagnosed by optical emission spectroscopic technique. Optical emission spectrum of the deuterium plasma was recorded in the wavelength region 350-900 nm. In the recorded spectrum; α; β; and γ Balmer atomic lines of deuterium were identified along with few neutral lines of chromium. The electron temperature of the deuterium plasma was measured by using Boltzmann plot.

For high performance ECR sources; the stray magnetic field of the source can provide focusing against the space charge blow-up of the beam in addition to the Direct Plasma Injection Scheme (DPIS) adapted from laser ion sources*. A combined extraction/matching system** has been designed for direct injection into a radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator; allowing a total beam current of 10 mA for the production of highly charged 238U40+ (1.33 mA) to be injected at an ion source voltage of 60 kV. In this design; the features of IGUN have been used to take into account the rf-focusing of an RFQ channel (without modulation); the electrostatic field between ion source extraction and the RFQ vanes; the magnetic stray field of the ECR superconducting solenoid; and the defocusing space charge of an ion beam. The RFQ has been designed to suppress neighbouring charge states and to work as a filter for the desired 238U40+. This reduces the transport problem for the beam line as well as it reduces the emittance for the selected charge state.; * R. Becker et al.; PROC.

Towards this goal; the development of an ion source that can provide a highly charged heavy ion beam with high intensity and low emittance is necessary. In order to provide the desired high intensity ion beam; the beam-radius expansion induced by space charge effects cannot be ignored; and it can cause considerable degradation of the beam emittance. To suppress such effects at the output of an ion source is one of the top priorities in the direction of improving both the quality and intensity of the beam. At first; we plan to examine the space charge effects with a high-intensity beam provided by the 18-GHz Superconducting ECR Ion Source at RIKEN Nishina Center. To measure the degradation of the beam emittance as function of the beam’s intensity; an in-situ emittance monitor system based on the pepperpot technique and applicable to a wide range of beam intensities is being developed.

The CI-ADS proton source developed at IMP can produced stable 35 keV/10 mA continuous wave (cw) beam at the RFQ entrance. The proton beam extracted by a 3-electrode extraction system passes through a low energy beam transport system (LEBT); which is composed of identical solenoids; into the 3.2 MeV radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ). In order to ensure superconducting cavities commissioning and protection; an electrostatic-chopper has been designed and installed in the LEBT line that can chop the cw beam into a pulsed one. The achieved fall/rise time of the chopper is less than 20 ns. In this paper; the performance of the proton source and the LEBT; such as beam reliability; emittance and beam current tuning will be presented.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/mopph009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/mopph009.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/mopph009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-MOPPH009,

Also; the continuous toroidal configuration of the permanent magnets gives additional magnetic confinement to the fast electrons by ECR heating; thereby generating more uniform and higher density plasma.

In the regime of maximum instantaneous bandwidth it delivers output power within a frequency interval of 2 GHz in Ka-band with a maximum power of 7 kW. One more setup includes a Ka-band pulsed amplifier with a peak power of up to 150 kW and bandwidth of about 10% capable for operation with 10% duty factor. The gyro-TWTs are based on DC oil-cooled solenoids and single-stage depressed collectors.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/tuobmh02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/tuobmh02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/tuobmh02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-TUOBMH02,

A. Koivisto; K. Ranttila; O.A. Tarvainen; JYFL; Jyväskylä; Finland; A project is underway for constructing a new 18 GHz ECR ion source HIISI at University of Jyväskylä. An innovative plasma chamber structure with grooves at magnetic poles is being studied. This allows large chamber radius at the poles; which is relevant for the performance of the ion source while smaller radius between the poles makes space for chamber water cooling. The hexapole will be refridgerated to sub-zero temperatures to boost the coercivity and the remanence of the permanent magnet material. The hexapole structure is insulated from high temperature solenoid coils and plasma chamber by vacuum. The thermal design of the structure has been made using a thermal diffusion code taking in account radiative; conductive and convective heat transfer processes. The heat flux from plasma has been estimated using electron trajectory simulations with sensitivity analysis on the electron energy distribution. The electron simulations are verified by comparing to experimental data from 14 GHz ECR. The electron and thermodynamic simulation efforts are presented together with an analysis of the H-field vs. coersivity in the permanent magnets.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/weommh04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/weommh04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/weommh04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-WEOMMH04,114

ECRIS2014,,WEOBMH03,Investigation on the Origin of High Energy X-Rays Observed in 3rd Generation ECRIS,LPSC; Grenoble Cedex; France; The operation of third generation ECR ion source heated with 24 or 28 GHz microwave frequency shows a high energy x-ray spectrum with a characteristic temperature much higher than the one observed at the usual heating frequencies (14-18 GHz). The behaviour of the x-ray spectrum is studied based on the review of a set of data previously done at LBNL [1]. The data reviewed shows that the hot x-ray temperature scales with the ECR frequency. The experimental data is compared with the prediction of a simple model of ECR heating developed for this purpose. A formula to estimate the ECR resonance thickness is calculated. The model explains nicely the experimental x-ray temperature variation when the central magnetic field of the ECRIS is changed. It demonstrates that such a magnetic field variation does not change the electron confinement time and that the change of the x-ray spectrum temperature is due to the change of the ECR zone thickness. The only way for the model to reproduce the fact that the x-ray temperature scales with the ECR frequency is to assume that the electron confinement time scales (at least) with the ECR frequency. This result brings new credit to the theoretical prediction that the hot electron RF scattering is decreasing when the ECR frequency increases.[2; 3] The spatial gyrac effect; which can be considered as another possible origin of the very hot x-ray produced in ECRIS is recalled for convenience in this paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/talks/weobmh03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/papers/weobmh03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ECRIS2014/posters/weobmh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ECRIS2014-WEOBMH03,127

Electron cyclotron instability (ECI) is a kinetic type instability; which is driven by the anisotropy of the energetic electrons distribution function traps with the transverse kinetic energy relative to the magnetic field dominating over the longitudinal one. One of the most interesting manifestations of ECI is the generation of bursts of electromagnetic radiation accompanied by hot electron precipitations from the trap. Such phenomena are observed in a wide range of plasma parameters: in the magnetospheres of the Earth and planets; in solar coronal loops; and in laboratory magnetic traps. Recently ECI were experimentally observed in ECR ion sources and it was shown that bursts of hot electrons escaping from the trap can destruct plasma confinement affecting highly charged ions beams current [1]. In this report we discuss basic mechanisms of cyclotron instability growth in non-equilibrium plasma of ECR discharge; main features of instability manifestation and its influence on ECRIS parameters.,,* O Tarvainen et al 2014 Plasma Sources Sci.
