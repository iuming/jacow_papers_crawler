        "the 10 kW high-power microwave considering for optimum operation at the 28 GHz ECR Ion Source",
        "were completed in 2013. The waveguide components were connected with a plasma chamber including a gas supply system. The plasma chamber and ion beam extraction were inserted into the warm bore of superconducting magnet. In this paper",
        "we present the current status of the installation of an ECR ion source and report on the test results for ECR plasma ignition."

        "A project is underway for constructing a new 18 GHz ECR ion source HIISI at University of Jyväskylä. An innovative plasma chamber structure with grooves at magnetic poles is being studied. This allows large chamber radius at the poles",
        "which is relevant for the performance of the ion source while smaller radius between the poles makes space for chamber water cooling. The hexapole will be refridgerated to sub-zero temperatures to boost the coercivity and the remanence of the permanent magnet material. The hexapole structure is insulated from high temperature solenoid coils and plasma chamber by vacuum. The thermal design of the structure has been made using a thermal diffusion code taking in account radiative",
        "conductive and convective heat transfer processes. The heat flux from plasma has been estimated using electron trajectory simulations with sensitivity analysis on the electron energy distribution. The electron simulations are verified by comparing to experimental data from 14 GHz ECR. The electron and thermodynamic simulation efforts are presented together with an analysis of the H-field vs. coersivity in the permanent magnets."
