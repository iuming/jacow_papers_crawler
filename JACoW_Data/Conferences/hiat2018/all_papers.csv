hiat2018,,MOXAA01,Nuclear Physics Research at Heavy Ion Accelerators: Precision Studies with Stored and Cooled Exotic Nuclei,Yu.A. Litvinov; T. Stöhlker; GSI; Darmstadt; Germany; X. Ma; Y.H. Zhang; IMP/CAS; Lanzhou; People’s Republic of China; HIJ; Jena; Germany; Saitama University; Saitama; Japan; Nuclear physics is more than 100 years old and is still rapidly developing field of research driven by the progress in accelerator concepts and detector technologies. By now; scientists have created in laboratory about 3000 nuclides. However; about 7000 nuclides are expected to exist with majority of yet unknown nuclei belonging to neutron-rich systems; which have extremely small production cross sections and short lifetimes. Sophisticated experimental techniques are needed for precision studies of such nuclides. Here; heavy-ion storage rings coupled to radioactive ion beam facilities offer unique capabilities. There are presently three operational facilities; namely the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at GSI; the experimental Cooler-Storage Ring (CSRe) at IMP; and the Rare RI Ring (R3) Facility at RIKEN [*]. Furthermore; dedicated low-energy storage ring facilities are being constructed or planned at various laboratories [**]. In this contribution I will try to illustrate the power of heavy-ion storage rings for unique precision studies at the forefront nuclear structure and astrophysics research. And; I will give my biased outlook onto the future experimental activities.; [*] Y. H. Zhang et al.; Phys. Scripta 91 (2016) 073002 [**] M. Lestinsky et al.; Eur. Phys. J.

High power test shows that the intervane voltage is over 60kV when the cavity power consumption is 48kW. The beam experiment was done and 1.8mA CW beam was obtained at the exit of RFQ with over 90% transmission efficiency.

In recent years; the performance of the accelerator has shown a gradual decline to a maximum operation voltage of ~14.5 MV. There are fundamental factors that limit the high voltage performance; such as the SF6 gas pressure; field enhancement due to triple junctions and total voltage effect. In addition; there are non-fundamental factors causing high voltage degradation. These are: operation with faulty ceramic gaps; operation at inappropriate voltage and SF6 pressure combinations; SF6 leaks into the vacuum space or use of SF6 and O2 as a stripper gases; poor electron suppression in the high energy stripper and frequent use of highly reactive ions such as Sulphur and Fluorine. In this paper we will discuss factors that limit the high voltage performance and an investigation of titanium (Ti) electrodes removed from accelerator after operation for few decades.

To meet the requirements; we systematically studied the optimization of RIKEN 28 GHz SC-ECRIS performance. Using these results; we produced ~400 μA of V13+ ion beam at the RF power of 2 kW (28 GHz) and very low Bext (~1.4 T for 28 GHz). For long term operation; we successfully produced the intense stable beam (100~200 microA). To further push this project forward; new super-conducting RF cavities are now under construction in the downstream of RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) to increase the beam energy. In this project; we also constructed new 28 GHz SC-ECRIS based on these results in order to increase the beam intensities. In addition; to inject the high quality beam into the upgraded RILAC; three sets of movable slits to control the size of the transverse emittance of the beam are installed in the low energy beam transport (LEBT).

This isocentric rotating gantry can transport carbon ions with the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over ±180 degrees; and is further capable of performing 3D raster-scanning irradiation. The combined-function superconducting magnets were employed for the gantry. The superconducting magnets with optimized beam optics allowed a compact gantry design with a large scan size at the isocenter; the length and the radius of the gantry are approximately 13 and 5.5 m; respectively; and the total weight is estimated to be approximately 300 tons. A construction of the gantry structure began since 2014; and the installation of the entire system to the HIMAC complex was completed by the end of September; 2015. Beam commissioning began since October; 2015; and beam tuning for carbon beams having energies of between 56-430 MeV/u over the entire gantry angles was performed. With the successful results of the beam commissioning; the gantry is being used for treatment operation since May 2017. We will present the overview of the development as well as the present status of the gantry.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hiat2018/talks/frxaa01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hiat2018/papers/frxaa01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/hiat2018/posters/frxaa01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-HIAT2018-FRXAA01,
