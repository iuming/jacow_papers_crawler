            "Nuclear physics is more than 100 years old and is still rapidly developing field of research driven by the progress in accelerator concepts and detector technologies. By now",
            "scientists have created in laboratory about 3000 nuclides. However",
            "about 7000 nuclides are expected to exist with majority of yet unknown nuclei belonging to neutron-rich systems",
            "which have extremely small production cross sections and short lifetimes. Sophisticated experimental techniques are needed for precision studies of such nuclides. Here",
            "heavy-ion storage rings coupled to radioactive ion beam facilities offer unique capabilities. There are presently three operational facilities",
            "namely the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at GSI",

In this contribution I will try to illustrate the power of heavy-ion storage rings for unique precision studies at the forefront nuclear structure and astrophysics research. And",

It is planed to accelerate 50mA deuteron CW beam to 1MeV. The 60kV intervene voltage is designed to decrease the risk of high voltage discharge since the RFQ works in CW mode. High power test shows that the intervane voltage is over 60kV when the cavity power consumption is 48kW. The beam experiment was done and 1.8mA CW beam was obtained at the exit of RFQ with over 90% transmission efficiency. It is the first time that window-type RFQ is used to accelerate light ion with high frequency(>100MHz). The experiment result shows that the window-type structure have great advantages in CW working mode."

As a first step a newly developed superconducting 15-gap Crossbar H-cavity (CH-cavity) operated at 217 MHz has been successfully tested with heavy ion beam up to the design beam energy of 1.85 MeV/u for the first time. The design energy gain of 3.5 MV within a length of less than 70 cm has been validated with heavy ion beams of up to 1.5 particle mueA. The measured beam parameters showed excellent beam quality",

The next two CH-cavities have already tested under cryogenic conditions. The results of the first successful heavy ion beam acceleration with a superconducting CH-cavity will be presented."

A detailed error analysis was performed after the optimization process. Field flatness error is analysed for determining a RF optimization target. The RF structure is designed based on a new type dynamics design. Electric field of the RF structure is optimized in order to supporting the dynam-ics design. The error analysis and detailed field flatness optimization of this compact RFQ have been presented and discussed in this paper."

It is planed to accelerate 50mA deuteron CW beam to 1MeV. The 60kV intervene voltage is designed to decrease the risk of high voltage discharge since the RFQ works in CW mode. High power test shows that the intervane voltage is over 60kV when the cavity power consumption is 48kW. The beam experiment was done and 1.8mA CW beam was obtained at the exit of RFQ with over 90% transmission efficiency. It is the first time that window-type RFQ is used to accelerate light ion with high frequency(>100MHz). The experiment result shows that the window-type structure have great advantages in CW working mode."

        "A prototype 81.25 MHz dual-beam drift tube linac (DB-DTL) is being designed to proof the feasibility of multi-beam type linac. The beam dynamics design and electromagnetic calculation have been completed [1]. The following step is the multi-physics analysis of the DB-DTL. The three-dimensional multi-physics analysis is very important for the design of the DB-DTL. The RF dissipated power will make the cavity temperature rise and cause cavity resonance frequency shifting due to the deformation of cavity structure. The distributions of cavity deformation and stress are calculated according to the cavity temperature distribution. All the simulation results",
        "including cavity temperature rise",
        "deformation and stress and the frequency shifting resulted in cavity deformation",
        "should be within an acceptable range. The designing goal is to design the DB-DTL operated in pulse model with 1/1000 duty factor. The detailed three-dimensional multi-physics analysis of the prototype DB-TL will be presented in this paper."

        "ion-accelerator-based test facilities are used. ISDE in cooperation with JINR have created and currently operates one of the few in the world and unique in Russia test facilities on the basis of U-400 and U-400M accelerators that provide all types of SEE radiation tests of electronic components of any functional class. The test facilities allow to irradiate devices under test in the following test environments: range of ions from С to Bi; initial energy from 3 to 60 (for light ions) MeV/A; LETs (Si) from 1 to 100 MeV×cm2/mg; ranges (Si) from 0.03 to 2 mm (depending on the energy); adjustable fluxes from 10 to 10+5 particles/(cm2 × s); irradiation area up to 200×200mm; beam nonuniformity less than 10 %. The paper presents a detailed description of the test facilities",

        "A superconducting rotating-gantry for carbon-ion radiotherapy was developed. This isocentric rotating gantry can transport carbon ions with the maximum energy of 430 MeV/u to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over ±180 degrees",
        "and is further capable of performing 3D raster-scanning irradiation. The combined-function superconducting magnets were employed for the gantry. The superconducting magnets with optimized beam optics allowed a compact gantry design with a large scan size at the isocenter; the length and the radius of the gantry are approximately 13 and 5.5 m",
