        "France and Japan. Typical microwave power of these setups obtained several tens kW with efficiency up to 40% (up to 65% with energy recovery) at the frequency range 24 ’ 84 GHz. The output power of gyrotrons can be smoothly regulated from about 0.5% to 100% of the full power in CW or pulsed mode. The next ambitious steps are broadband frequency tuning and fast power modulation. The results in the development of the electron cyclotron resonance ion sources have proven the potential of an increase in the operating frequency for the production of high intensity multicharge ion beams. The report present detail description of the 45 GHz system for FECRAL ECRIS",
