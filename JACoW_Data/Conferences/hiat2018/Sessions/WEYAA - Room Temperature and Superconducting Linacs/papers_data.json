        "which aims to design and build an ADS demonstration facility with the capability of more than 10 MW thermal power in multiple phases lasting about 20 years. In the first phase",
        "a demo linac has been constructed and commissioned successfully to demonstrate the key technologies of the high-power CW mode superconducting linac. Followed the China ADS roadmap",
        "a superconducting driver linac with 500MeV and 5mA proton beam is designed for the second phase of China Initiative Accelerator Driven Subcritical System (CiADS) program. The commissioning results of the China ADS 25 MeV demo linac and the RAMI oriented beam physics design of CiADS linac are presented in this paper."

        "one of the beams is deflected via a fast switching magnet to a lower energy experimental area while the other is further accelerated through the third linac stage of ATLAS. Details of the proposed implementation and the expected gains from this upgrade will be presented. In addition to enhancing the nuclear physics program",
