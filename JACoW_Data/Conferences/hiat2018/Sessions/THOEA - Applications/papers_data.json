        "Heavy ions of outer space are the major threat to the correct operation of modern spacecraft electronic components due to single event effects (SEE)",
        "which can result in a failure of spacecraft system equipment. For modeling heavy-ion space environment in testing laboratories",
        "ion-accelerator-based test facilities are used. ISDE in cooperation with JINR have created and currently operates one of the few in the world and unique in Russia test facilities on the basis of U-400 and U-400M accelerators that provide all types of SEE radiation tests of electronic components of any functional class. The test facilities allow to irradiate devices under test in the following test environments: range of ions from С to Bi; initial energy from 3 to 60 (for light ions) MeV/A; LETs (Si) from 1 to 100 MeV×cm2/mg; ranges (Si) from 0.03 to 2 mm (depending on the energy); adjustable fluxes from 10 to 10+5 particles/(cm2 × s); irradiation area up to 200×200mm; beam nonuniformity less than 10 %. The paper presents a detailed description of the test facilities",
