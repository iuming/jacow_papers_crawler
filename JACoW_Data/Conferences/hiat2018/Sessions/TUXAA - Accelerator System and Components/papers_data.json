        "was recently installed and commissioned at the Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System (ATLAS). RAISOR is a chicane of four dipoles with four complementary quadrupoles",
        "and will enable the selection of secondary radioactive ion beams produced via the in-flight method. RAISOR will expand the scope of the in-flight beam program at ATLAS by improving beam purity",
        "increasing the allowable primary beam intensity",
        "and enabling secondary beam delivery to all ATLAS high energy target stations. Along with the magnets",
        "new diagnostics and high power slits were installed to identify low intensity secondary beams and safely dump the high intensity primary beam",
        "respectively. Commissioning results and the expected performance of the full system will be presented."
