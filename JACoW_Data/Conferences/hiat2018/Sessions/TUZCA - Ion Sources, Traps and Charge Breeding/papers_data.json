        "An Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) charge breeder is in operation at Argonne National Laboratory as part of the CAlifornium Rare Ion Breeder Upgrade (CARIBU). The EBIS replaced the ECR charge breeder in 2016",
        "was commissioned on-line in 2017",
        "and delivery of radioactive beams for the ATLAS physics program began in 2018. The source has produced stable and radioactive beams with A/Q <6",
        "breeding times <30 ms",
        "and charge breeding efficiencies >18% into a single charge state. The source has also demonstrated a substantial reduction in beam contamination levels when compared to the ECR charge breeder",
        "with the radioactive species accounting for >80% of the beam incident on target",
        "whereas with the ECR the fraction was <3%. The dynamics of charge bred ion extraction from the trapping region have been investigated as well as methods to lengthen the extracted beam pulse."
