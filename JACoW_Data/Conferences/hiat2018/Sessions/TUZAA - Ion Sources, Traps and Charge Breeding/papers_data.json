        "production of the intense metallic ion beams (e.g.",
        "Ti",
        "V and Cr ion beams) were strongly required. To meet the requirements",
        "we systematically studied the optimization of RIKEN 28 GHz SC-ECRIS performance. Using these results",
        "we produced ~400 μA of V13+ ion beam at the RF power of 2 kW (28 GHz) and very low Bext (~1.4 T for 28 GHz). For long term operation",
        "we successfully produced the intense stable beam (100~200 microA). To further push this project forward",
        "new super-conducting RF cavities are now under construction in the downstream of RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) to increase the beam energy. In this project",
        "we also constructed new 28 GHz SC-ECRIS based on these results in order to increase the beam intensities. In addition",
        "to inject the high quality beam into the upgraded RILAC",
        "three sets of movable slits to control the size of the transverse emittance of the beam are installed in the low energy beam transport (LEBT). In this contribution",
        "we present the status of new 28 GHz ECRIS and LEBT. We also present the results of the systematic study and the production of the intense metallic ion beams."
