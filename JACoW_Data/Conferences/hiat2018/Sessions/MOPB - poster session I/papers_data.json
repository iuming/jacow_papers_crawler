        "The Facility of Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) superconducting magnets are used to focus and steer the heavy ion beams of the FRIB driver linac. All the magnets are designed as a solenoid with bucking coils to suppress the stray field and have superconducting dipole correctors to steer both horizontal and vertical field. Two types of magnets are manufactured in China and some of them have been tested at Institute of Modern Physic(IMP). This paper describes the measurement facilities and magnetic axis measurement method. We also present a summary of the measurement process and test results of the magnetic performance for the magnets."

The three-dimensional multi-physics analysis is very important for the design of the DB-DTL.

The distributions of cavity deformation and stress are calculated according to the cavity temperature distribution. All the simulation results",
