In order to validate the expected behaviour a novel measurement technique was developed",

        "in collaboration with KEK within TYL-FJPPL Particle Physics Laboratory. Marui has invented and patented a rotative cathode called ‘i-Ninja'. The version 5 has been tested for the first time in Europe at CEA Saclay. The four wings of the cathode remove efficiently",
        "bubbles of hydrogen",
        "and the chosen parameters make it possible to achieve better surface and uniform material removal compared to VEP with a fixed cathode. The effect of the temperature of the cavity walls on current oscillations has been precisely studied. Two single-cell cavities have been electro-polished and tested at 2 K in vertical cryostat and the results will be presented."
