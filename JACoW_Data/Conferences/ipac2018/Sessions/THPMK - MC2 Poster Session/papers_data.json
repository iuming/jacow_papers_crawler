        "sufficient bunch lengthening is also essential for conserving the ultralow emittance and reducing heat load on vacuum components at high current. It is therefore of interest to study methods to serve timing users while operating without gap in the fill pattern. Once such method is PPRE",

        "we propose a novel rotationally symmetric 1.6 cell RF gun to construct the symmetric field in this paper. The concrete proposal is that a coaxial cell with a symmetrical distribution of four grooves is concatenated to the first 0.6 cell at the photocathode end to form a new resonant cell (NRC) to mantain the symmetric multi-pole field in 1.6 cell. Our simulations indicate that 3D multi-pole fields of NRC are with the perfect symmetry. After that",
        "the profile of the RF gun is optimized to improve the shunt impedance and mode separation and make the surface peak electric field at the photocathode end. Our simulations demonstrate promising outlook of using coaxial cell for photocathode RF guns with various applications."

By correlating the electron slices of neighboring cooperation distances this can lengthen the collective interaction and thus enhance the spectral brightness. In the existing literature most studies rely on numerical simulations and there is limited work on analytical analysis. In this paper we formulate the problem of slippage enhanced SASE (SeSASE) high-gain FEL with inclusion of by-pass magnetic chicanes. The analysis takes the finite energy spread of the electron beam and the nonzero momentum compaction of the chicane into consideration. The evolution of spectral bandwidth of SeSASE is compared with that of usual SASE in theory and numerical simulations. The effects of finite beam energy spread and non-isochronisity are also quantified.",

However the FEL sideband signal begins to exponentially grow in the post-saturation regime. In this paper we extend our sideband analysis* by including both the energy detune due to discrete undulator tapering and longitudinal space charge in an effective 1-D model. A dispersion relation with explicit energy detune and space charge is derived. The study is carried out semi-analytically and compared with simulations. The impact of energy detune and space charge is analyzed."

The target beam emittance is below 1.0 nm·rad with a maximum beam current of 300mA. The injector utilizes a full energy C-band linac with a photocathode RF electron gun. The storage ring RF system is based on a 500MHz frequency. The EU-HOM damped cavity and the new SPring-8 design TM020 cavity is the choice of the storage ring cavity. The RF power unit for storage ring can either be a high-power klystron feeding all RF cavities or a combination of low power IOTs or solid-state amplifiers feeding each cavity. The high gradient C-band structure is considered as the main accelerating structure for linac. The RF power system for linac will base on klystron and a modular modulator.

The results show that the storage ring can oper-ate at a higher beam current and the parasitic high-er-order mode of the fundamental cavity has less impact on the beam by using superconducting harmonic cavity."

        "We have been developing a laser-Compton scattering X-ray source using multi-bunch linac and optical enhancement cavity. This combination have a possibility to realize a high brightness compact X-ray source. A key issue of the system is around interaction point. Compatibility of electron focusing",
        "optical cavity and X-ray path is difficult in the current setup. Thus we propose to use rf transverse deflecting cavity for crab crossing of laser and electron. In this conference",
        "design study of the whole laser-Compton X-ray source consist of electron linac and optical enhancement cavity will be reported. The system configuration",
        "resulting flux and brightness",
        "and its applications will be discussed."
