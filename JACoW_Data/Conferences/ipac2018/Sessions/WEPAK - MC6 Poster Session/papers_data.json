The sensitivity of the spill to power supply ripples are studied by introducing external ripples. An estimate of sources of inherent power supply ripples along with ripple magnitude are thus obtained. Spill characterization in time and frequency domain are discussed and exemplified by a typical spill and the differences from an ideal or Poisson spill. An appropriate spill characterization aims to provide a suitable abstraction for communication about the spill quality requirements between accelerator operations and users. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

For theoretical investigations of the TRIBs a reliable nonlinear optics of the machine is required and thus all measurable global observables for the nonlinear optics are of great interest. The measurement of the TSWA for the BESSY II standard optics was performed using an injection kicker to excite high amplitude betatron oscillations and then extract the amplitude dependant frequency from the synchrotron radiation damped oscillation with a Hilbert transformation. With TRIBs optics the injection kicker was not able to sufficienty excite the beam. The impact and correctability of the BPM nonlinearity at the reached amplitudes and the reason for the failure of the excitation method for our TRIBs optics shall be looked onto in this paper. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "sixty-four pules magnets were installed in the KEK e+/e− LINAC for simultaneous injection to four different rings. Since each ring requires different injection energy",
        "magnetic field in the LINAC has to be changed shot by shot (every 20 ms) according to the destination of the beam. To realize such operation",
        "a PXI express based new control system was installed. Each unit",
        "which consists of an event receiver board",
        "a DAC board",
        "and a ADC board",
        "can set and monitor output current up to 8 pulsed power supply in 16 bit resolution. The timing and control system are integrated in that of the LINAC by using Micro-Research Finland's PXI event receiver board. In terms of software",
        "Windows 8.1 and LabVIEW 2016 were mainly adopted to control the hardware. EPICS channel access (CA) protocol was used to communicate with operator's interface panels. In addition to real-time monitoring by EPICS CA and logging by CSS archiver every 10 s",
        "data are logged every shot (every 20 ms) in the text file together with timestamp",
        "shot ID and destination. At present",
        "thirteen units are stably in operation to control 64 magnets. Further installation of the system is planned in 2018."
