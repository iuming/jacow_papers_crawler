        "Relativistic electrons can oscillate above the Earth trapped in the radiation belts (known as the Van Allen Belts). These electrons",
        "which can originate from the solar wind or a high-altitude nuclear explosion",
        "have the potential to damage satellites in low-Earth orbit. For example",
        "in 1962",
        "the US detonated the Starfire warhead at an altitude of about 400 km. The unexpected resulting enhancement of the radiation belts disabled several satellites within a few months and energetic electrons remained trapped in the radiation belts for up to several years. In order to address this potential vulnerability",
        "schemes have been proposed to drain electrons from the radiation belts",
        "with the most promising based on using high-power RF waves to couple to the trapped electrons. This talk will provide an overview of radiation belt remediation including the use of electron accelerators to drive these RF waves."
