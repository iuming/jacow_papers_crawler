        "SwissFEL is the new X-ray free-electron laser facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland. It was inaugurated in December 2016 and saw its first pilot experiments at the end of 2017. We describe the commissioning steps leading to the first phase of pilot experiments and outline the plans towards reaching nominal performance levels in 2018."

        "which is extremely useful for maintaining high stability of machine and time-resolved experiments with high time resolution. Our low phase noise timing system and high stability high power RF system enable this low jitter. Our measurement shows 10 fs jitter of e-bunch arrival time at the injector and it increased ~20 fs due to e-bunch energy variation. The possibility of improving the final jitter is described based on the optimization of bunch compressors and longitudinal feedback."

Electron bunchs of quite different lengths are separately used in each stage of EEHG and a monochromator is employed to purify the radiation from the first stage for seeding the second one. Theoretical analysis and 3D simulations show that the proposed scheme can generate fully coherent hard X-ray pulses directly from a conventional UV seed laser.",
