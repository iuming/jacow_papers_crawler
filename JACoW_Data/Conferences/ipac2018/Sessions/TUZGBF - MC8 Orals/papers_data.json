        "it is thought as divided in the longitudinal plane in several slices while each slice is divided in the transverse plane in several spots called voxels. Considering the dose uniformity that can be obtained during extraction",
        "the machine must extract an average intensity related to the voxel that requires less dose. Therefore during a treatment",
        "for some slices",
        "a technique is needed to lower the extracted beam intensity with respect to the nominal one. A way to guarantee the correct average intensity according to the treatment planning requirements",
        "is to introduce a mechanical filter (a degrader) that reduces the intensity of the accelerated particles. However this method used in the first treatments at CNAO showed some disadvantages and it has been replaced by what has been called the \"dynamic betatron\" method. The paper shows the implementations and the advantages of this method in the CNAO treatments."

        "as well as the acquisition of a cyclotron capable of accelerating protons to 70 MeV at beam currents in excess of 700 microampere. This development will be approached in two phases: Phase 1 will include the migration of the existing radioisotope production from the separated-sector cyclotron (SSC) to a new 70 MeV cyclotron. This rearrangement will increase the isotope production capability and also free up the SSC for research. In phase 2",
        "beams of artificial isotopes will be produced at energies up to 5 MeV/nucleon to allow iThemba LABS to expand its research capabilities to new frontiers. The various different aspects of the proposed project will be discussed."
