        "The latest design of the Future Circular electron-positron Collider (FCC-ee) foresees a luminosity per interaction point above 2.0·1036/cm2/s for operation at the Z pole. The filling from zero current occurs in collision to profit from the bunch lengthening due to beamstrahlung (so-called bootstrapping). At any time when new e- and e+ buckets or bunchlets are injected into the collider",
        "they will collide instantly. For this reason",
        "we may provide the charge in each injected bunch in a way to pre-compensate for anticipated beam loss",
        "and to reach the target luminosity as soon as possible after the first injection. In this way",
        "we optimise the injection schedules for Z-mode so as to reach the peak luminosity in less than 20 minutes by interleaved injection of the two species at some portion of full bucket charge. Filling from zero the injector should allow accumulating 1.7·1011 particles in one collider bucket within at least 10 injections",
        "assuming a total transmission above 80%. In steady-state operation",
        "the injector chain continually produces and accelerates lower bunch charges so as to maintain nearly constant bunch currents and constant peak luminosity."

In this article we describe the development to use driven oscillations to measure the transverse coupling with high intensity beams. The method relies on the use of the transverse damper to drive an oscillation in a similar way as with an AC-dipole. The calculation of the coupling is based on the turn-by-turn data from all available BPMs gated for the excited bunch. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "the knowledge of aperture at top energy allows pushing the optics to reduce the colliding beam sizes. The standard method used in the LHC commissioning requires using several bunches for one measurement and makes bunches un-usable for other activities. This paper presents first global aperture measurements performed at injection with a new method using the AC dipole. This method consists in exciting large coherent oscillations of the beam without spoiling its emittance. A gentle control of the oscillation amplitude enables re-using the beams for several measurements. These measurements are compared with aperture measurements performed using the standard method and possible benefits",

The method is based on the identification of Bhabha scattering events at low polar angle (∼10 degree) around the beam axis by using two small crystal calorimeters shared with the KLOE-2 experiment. A new experimental setup has been designed and realized in order to implement the fast luminosity monitor",

In ion operation the cleaning efficiency of the collimation system is lower than in the case of protons and the ion showering process is more complicated and produces a larger variety of secondary particles. In particular",
        "lighter ion species can be produced as fragmentation products in the collimation system and specialised physics lists are required to simulate their production and propagation in matter. The Geant4 toolkit offers comprehensive physics process lists that extend to the case of arbitrary ion species at high energies. First results from a study of ion collimation for the LHC using the Geant4 physics library in BDSIM are presented here. These include simulations of a full ring loss map and particle spectra for collimator leakage for a Pb beam at injection energy in the LHC."
