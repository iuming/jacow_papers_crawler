        "For the PETRA IV project at DESY it is planned to convert the 6 GeV synchrotron light source PETRA III into a diffraction limited storage ring with ultra-low emittances. PETRA IV should provide a natural emittance two orders of magnitude smaller as now. The energy and the current of 100 mA should be unchanged. Currently different lattice options are investigated to achieve an emittance in the range of 10-30 pm*rad. As one candidate for a lattice of PETRA IV a ring based on the concept of hybrid multi-bend achromats (HMBA) has been studied in detail. Due to the unique layout of PETRA III with long straight sections it is possible to use damping wigglers to reduce the emittance further. While this helps to mitigate intrabeam scattering it has the disadvantage of an increased energy spread. The linear and nonlinear parameters of this HMBA-based lattice and the influence of damping wigglers on beam parameters are discussed."

In order to study their effect on the beam dynamics a special collimator has been built and installed in the machine. Its jaws are coated with three different materials and can be moved transversely to selectively expose the beam to the chosen coating. We have measured the resistive wall tune shifts of each coating material and compared them with that of a standard Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) collimator jaw. A resolution of the tune shift of the order of 10-5 has been achieved in the measurement. The results show a significant reduction of the resistive wall tune shift with novel materials. The largest improvement is obtained with a 5 μm Molybdenum coating of a Molybdenum-Graphite jaw. The observed tune shifts show a good agreement with the impedance model and the bench impedance and resistivity measurements. Obtained results can be used to further improve the precision of the impedance model. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "are produced in a 40 MHz RF system applying a bunch rotation at the end of the cycle and therefore cannot be perfectly matched to the 200 MHz SPS RF bucket. The possibility of using a lower harmonic additional RF capture system in the SPS was already proposed after the LEP era in preparation for transfer of the LHC beam but the bunch rotation was the preferred solution",
        "since the induced voltage in the SPS 200 MHz RF system would be too large to ensure stability in a low harmonic system without mitigation measures. However",
        "the use of the upgraded one-turn feedback and the 200 MHz RF system as a Landau cavity could help to improve stability. The feasibility of this scenario to reduce capture losses in the SPS is analysed and presented in this paper. The choice of an optimum RF frequency and voltage is also discussed. The transfer to the main 200 MHz is simulated using a realistic bunch distribution."

      "abstract": "Employing Synergia simulations with the DMD method we investigate the Landau damping of space charge modes in bunched beams. The simulations reveal two instances of the parametric damping mechanism in bunched beams. The first example occurs in the proximity of coupling resonance and is due to the oscillation of particles' amplitudes in the transverse plane. This oscillation modulates the mode-particle coupling with particle dependent trapping frequency. The second example is due to the modulation of the mode-particle coupling in one transverse plane by the oscillatory motion in the other plane. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Sextupole magnets provide position-dependent momentum kicks and are tuned to provide the correct kicks to particles within a small acceptance region in phase space. Sextupoles are useful and even necessary in circular accelerators for chromaticity corrections. They are routinely used in most rings",
        "i.e. CESR. Although sextupole magnets are necessary for particle energy corrections",
        "they also have undesirable effects on dynamic aperture",
        "especially because of their non-linear coupling term in the momentum kick. Studies of integrable systems suggest that there is an analytic way to create transport lattices with specific transfer matrices that limit the momentum kick to one dimension. A one-dimension sextupole is needed for chromaticity corrections: a horizontal sextupole for horizontal bending magnets. We know how to make a \"composite\" horizontal sextupole using regular 2D sextupoles and linear transfer matrices in an ideal thin-lens approximation. Thus",
        "one could create an accelerator lattice using linear elements",

These effects make some particles move on to a machine resonance and become unstable. Linear elements of beam optics cannot reduce the tune spread induced by SC because of its intrinsic nonlinear nature. We investigate the possibility to mitigate it by a thin McMillan lens providing a nonlinear axially symmetric kick",
        "which is qualitatively opposite to the accumulated kick by SC. Experimentally",
