        "the design of the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC) is addressed. A proposed layout for the interaction region for the containing the radio frequency (RF) cavities and various beam instrumentation will be discussed. The higher energy requires more RF cavities",
        "which strongly restricts the space available for optics and instrumentation. Another challenge arises because the beam rigidity increases whilst the LHC geometry has to be conserved. To this end",
        "next generation dipoles have to be used in order to achieve sufficient beam to beam separation. A design that provides enough beam stay clear (BSC) in all the magnets will be presented. The design introduces an additional quadrupole on either side of the RF region to be used for phase advance adjustments that can increase the dynamic aperture."

Using the 16 T dipoles developed for the FCC-hh the center of mass energy of the LHC is set to increase to 27 TeV. To achieve this set energy goal",

Initial considerations take into account the physical aperture at the proposed injection energy as well as the energy reach of these lattices. The dynamic aperture at the injection energies is determined using latest evaluations of the field quality of the main dipoles."

These beta functions are proportional to the square of the length of the final drift so it is desirable to keep it as short as possible whilst leaving enough room for the experiment. In the latest design of the FCC-hh this drift was reduced from 45 m to 40 m. In the following an alternative final focus for this new design will be presented. The effects this change has on the interaction region will examined and discussed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "Jefferson Lab is in the process of designing an electron-ion collider with unprecedented luminosity at a 65 GeV center-of-mass energy. This luminosity relies on ion cooling in both the booster and the storage ring of the accelerator complex. The cooling in the booster will use a conventional DC cooler similar to the one at COSY. The high-energy storage ring",
        "operating at a momentum of up to 100 GeV/nucleon",
        "requires novel use of bunched-beam cooling. We will present a new design for a Circulator Cooler Ring for bunched-beam electron cooling. This requires the generation and transport of very high-charge magnetized bunches",
        "acceleration of the bunches in an energy recovery linac",
        "and transfer of these bunches to a circulating ring that passes the bunches 11 times through the proton or ion beam inside cooling solenoids. This design requires the suppression of the effects of space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation using shielding and RF compensation."

        "Crab crossing is an integral part of the Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider (JLEIC) design to achieve high luminosity while meeting the detection and physics pro-gram requirements. The crab crossing scheme provides a head-on beam-beam collision for beams with a nonzero crossing angle. Simulations of crabbing dynamics currently do not include beam-beam effects. We describe a framework for accurate simulation of beam-beam effects on crabbing dynamics by applying a numerical calculation of the Bassetti-Erskine analytic solution to symplectic particle tracking codes. The numerical calculation is benchmarked against the analytic solution by calculating the luminosity reduction for several colliding beam scenarios. Benchmarking results show good agreement be-tween the numerical calculation and analytic solution",

        "due to the asymmetric bunch train structure between the electron and the ion beam",
        "such modulation results in shifting collision point and leads to reduced luminosity. We have carried out the beam based experiments at BEPC-II and ALS using bunch-by-bunch diagnostic capabilities of the coupled-bunch feedback systems to study this transient effect. A modulated bunch filling pattern with higher charge density around the gap has been demonstrated to be effective in partially compensating this transient modulation. Details of the experimental setups and the data analysis will be presented to this conference."
