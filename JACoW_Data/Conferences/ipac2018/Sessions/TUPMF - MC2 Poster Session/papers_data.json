Here we present the preparation and characterization of a Cu photocathode plug and the diagnostics to insert the photocathode in the back wall of the SRF cavity. A polycrystalline bulk Cu plug was polished",

The pulsed wire measurement method is the only technique that we are aware of that allows for sub micrometer precision and the ability to distinguish between the various quadrupoles within the wiggler. A one period prototype wiggler was manufactured and subsequently measured using the pulsed wire technique. The goal of the measurements was to verify that the magnetic centers of each quadrupole could be located and aligned to each other within the required precision.

The injection section configuration was optimized within a multi-dimensional parameter space and made consistent with up-to-date technical developments. The booster-to-storage ring (BTS) transport line was designed to bring the electron beam from the existing Booster to the new storage ring (SR). Due to various limitations",
        "this new BTS line is twisted both horizontally and vertically when approaching the injection point",
        "which introduces challenges in both geometrical and optical matching. This paper presents our simple solution to these issues. The coupling effect caused by the twisted BTS line is also discussed."

      "abstract": "704 MHz deflecting cavity was designed for the Low Energy RHIC electron Cooling (LEReC) project. The cavity will serve as a major component in diagnostic line. In LEReC project the requirement on the energy spread of the electron beam is extremely high (better than 10-4) and the diagnostic system has to to be designed accordingly. The 704 MHz transverse deflecting cavity provides the vertical kick to the beam after it passes through the dispersion dipole so that we can measure the energy spread of the core of the bunch. Traditional way of determining the electrical center of the cavity involves the needle pulling and integration of the signal which is prone to the cumulative error. We present the measurement result from a wire stretching system that is much more efficient and accurate compared to the bead/needle pulling method. Both simulation and experimental results are shown in this paper and the potential in further application is discussed at the end. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

These demands include photon beams that are highly focussed and beams with high transverse coherence. Both these requirements are achieved with ultralow electron beam emittance. The practical development of the multi-bend achromat (MBA) concept by MAX IV has spurred many synchrotron light sources around the world to develop similar machines. For existing facilities two options are available: upgrading existing machines or building a new structure. The Canadian Light Source (CLS) has explored both options and has determined a new storage ring is required. Several design options for a 3.0 GeV ring have been developed. Best results are achieved when tracking is used to optimize the phase advance through the MBA structure to reduce the impact of the sextupoles on the dynamic aperture. Structures where no geometric sextupoles are required have been achieved while producing ultralow emittances. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "RF induced intra-bunch-train trajectory variations were found to be responsible for significant variations of the SASE intensity within one bunch train. This work presents the latest achievements in improving the multi-bunch FEL performance by reducing the intra-bunch-train variation of RF parameters. Particular attention is given to the static and dynamic detuning of the cavities. It will be shown that the current level of LLRF control is suitable to limit the variation of RF parameters considerably."

        "PETRA~III is a 6 GeV hard X-ray synchrotron radiation source at DESY in Hamburg (Germany) and is in user operation since~2010. The natural emittance of PETRA III is extremely low with 1.3 nm*rad and the coupling is typically less than 1%. PETRA III is operated with a beam current of 100 mA using two different filling modes: a continuous mode with 960 bunches and a timing mode with 40 bunches. It has been observed that the horizontal emittance depends on the filling pattern and is in timing mode slightly larger compared to the emittance in the continuous mode. Despite the high energy of 6 GeV intrabeam scattering contributes for a slight emittance growth due to the small natural emittance and coupling of the machine. The increase of the emittance as a function of the single bunch current has been measured by using different filling patterns at a fixed beam current of 100 mA. The measurements of the emittance and the lifetime as a function of the single bunch current will be compared with theoretical expectations of the emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering and the Touschek lifetime."

        "PETRA III is a third generation synchrotron light source at DESY delivering high brightness photon beams for users at 21 beam lines. It is operated at 6 GeV with a beam current of 100 mA in top-up mode and is in operation for users since 2010. An off-axis injection scheme is used to accumulate beam from the booster synchrotron DESY II in PETRA III. Three fast injection kicker magnets generate a closed orbit bump for one turn to move the stored beam near to the injection septum magnet. Ideally the orbit bump generated by the 10 μs long half-sine pulses of the kickers should be closed. Due to differences in pulse shape as well as timing and amplitude errors of the pulses there is some leakage of the injection bump which disturbs the closed orbit and affects the beam quality during top-up operation. Turn-by-turn data from the beam position monitor (BPM) system of PETRA III have been used to measure the bump leakage for different bucket positions in the filling pattern. The procedure to reduce the injection kicker bump leakage and the achieved improvement will be discussed."
