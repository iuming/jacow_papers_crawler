        "The Advanced Photon Source (APS) is currently in the preliminary design phase for a multi-bend acromat (MBA) lattice upgrade. Beam stability is critical where the requirements are driven from the beam size which is expected to approach 4 microns vertically at the insertion device (ID) source points. AC rms beam stability requirements are defined as 10 % the minimum source size at the ID in the band 0.01-1000 Hz. The vertical plane stability goal is the most ambitious requiring a stability of 400 nm at the ID source point. In addition",
        "long term drift defined as motion over a seven day timescale can be no more than 1 micron. In order to achieve these demanding beam stability requirements",

        "transverse multi-bunch feedback system and current monitors are planned for the upgrade. We report on the beam diagnostics design and APS storage ring R&D results used to inform the design."

A potential mitigation can be provided by wideband feedback systems with a frequency reach of about 1 GHz . For this reason",
        "the development of a prototype system has been started in a CERN collaboration within the US-LARP framework in 2008. In this report we present latest experimental results in 2017 where this prototype system was used in single and multi-bunch studies. In particular",
