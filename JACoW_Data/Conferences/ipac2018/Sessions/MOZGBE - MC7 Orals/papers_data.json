        "Charge strippers are almost inevitable for accelerations in heavy-ion accelerator complex. The fixed solid strip-pers including carbon-foil strippers are difficult to be used in on-going or upcoming new-generation in-flight RI beam facilities",
        "e.g.",
        "RIBF (RIKEN",
        "Japan)",
        "FAIR (GSI",

        "FRIB (NSCL/MSU",
        "US)",
        "HIAF (IMP",
        "China) and RAON (RISP",
        "Korea). The He gas stripper developed at RIBF is the first successful stripper significantly be-yond the applicable limit of the fixed carbon-foil strip-pers. We discuss the development of the gas strippers at RIBF and overview the related new-generation strippers being developed in the world."
