        "the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) upgrade",
        "LCLS-II",
        "is considering complex schemes such as two-color operation [1]",
        "while the plasma wake field acceleration facility for advanced accelerator experimental tests (FACET) upgrade",
        "FACET-II",
        "is planning on providing custom tailored current profiles [2]. Because of uncertainty due to limited diagnostics and time varying performance",
        "such as thermal drifts",
        "as well as collective effects and the complex coupling of large numbers of components",
        "it is impossible to use simple look up tables for parameter settings in order to quickly switch between widely varying operating ranges. Several forms of artificial intelligence are currently being investigated in order to enable accelerators to quickly and automatically re-adjust component settings without human intervention. In this work we discuss recent progress in applying neural networks and adaptive feedback algorithms to enable automatic accelerator tuning and optimization.",

The LCLS-II Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) collaboration is a multi-lab effort within the Department of Energy (DOE) accelerator complex. The necessity of high longitudinal beam stability of LCLS-II imposes tight amplitude and phase stability requirements on the LLRF system (up to 0.01% in amplitude and 0.01° in phase RMS). This is the first time such requirements are expected of superconducting cavities operating in continuous-wave (CW) mode. Initial measurements on the Cryomodule test stands at partner labs have shown that the early production units are able to meet the extrapolated hardware requirements to achieve such levels of performance. A large effort is currently underway for system integration",
