        "Along 2017 ALBA magnetic measurements facility has measured LIPAc HEBT quadrupoles and dipole designed by CIEMAT and built by ELYTT company. ALBA magnetic measurements laboratory has been improved through an upgrade program of its measurement benches to complete their measurements. One of the main aims of the upgrade has been to standardize both the hardware and software and therefore ensure an easy maintenance. Especially relevant has been the upgrade of the flipping coil bench",
        "in which the DC motors and the obsolete controller have been replaced by step-motors and ICEPAP controller. Also",
        "software has been migrated to Tango package. Hardware and software of Hall probe bench has been upgraded as well",
        "using the last DeltaTau motion controller. Tango has been upgraded too",
        "using Devian 8 as operative system. Next step will be the upgrade of the rotating coil hardware and software using also step-motor and ICEPAP controller. In parallel",
        "new shafts have been build and tested",
        "with specific designs to improve the sensitivity and minimize the noise to signal ratio. In this contribution we detail the upgrades and the results of performance tests."

        "The upgrade (APS-U) of the APS storage ring requires more than 1200 bipolar power supplies. Based on the performance requirement",
        "the power supplies can be divided into two categories: fast bipolar power supplies for fast correctors and slow bipolar power supplies for trim coils and slow correctors. The common requirement of the power supplies is a bipolar output current up to ±15 A. The main difference is that the fast corrector power supplies require a small-signal bandwidth of 10 kHz. A prototype DC/DC power converter utilizing a MOSFET H-bridge circuit with a 500 kHz PWM was successfully developed through the R&D program",

The beam loading resulting from such offset can greatly incur in large power requirements to the RF amplifier. The choice of external Q for the Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) is critical to limit the power requirement to practical values. The loaded Q of the eRHIC crab cavities is mainly governed by the external Q of the FPC",

This paper discusses the choice of external Q for the FPC of the eRHIC crab cavities and introduces the design of a preliminary FPC antenna concept that would provide the appropriate external Q."

In order to fabricate and test this concept in a timely and cost effective manner we propose to reuse the inner coils from an existing high gradient Nb3Sn LARP quadrupole inside a new structure with a new NbTi active shield coil. The main challenge is to design a compact structure for applying prestress to the Nb3Sn coil that fits the restricted space inside the shield coil. We first construct a 15 cm long mechanical model of this structure with coil strain gauges to verify the design concept before proceeding with the full coil. Mechanical modeling results and our preliminary design concept are reported here."

High fields are readily achieved by using small magnet gaps. This is possible due to the small beam sizes involved. Reduction in the physical aperture and the reduction in the good field region requirements results in magnets with compact transverse dimensions. The very strong focusing of the magnets results in very small drift spaces between the various magnetic elements. To keep these drift spaces clear magnets with recessed coils have been studied. In such magnets the coils do not stick out beyond the end of the magnet yoke in the longitudinal direction. By placing the coils on the outer yoke loss of efficiency can be avoided while maintaining good control of the higher order field harmonics. This is very well suited for quadrupole magnets where only two coils are required. Possible designs for gradient dipoles and sexutpoles are also considered. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "A highly reliable kicker system is required as part of the injection for the FCC. A significant weak point of conventional kicker systems is often the pulse generator, where a Pulse Forming Network/Line (PFN/PFL) is discharged through a thyratron switch to generate the current pulse for the kicker magnet. This design has several disadvantages: in particular the occasional erratic turn-on of the switch which cannot be accepted for the FCC. A potential replacement is the inductive adder (IA) that uses semiconductor switches and distributed capacitors as energy storage. The modular design, low maintenance and high flexibility make the IA a very interesting alternative. In addition, the ability to both turn-on and off the current also permits the replacement of PFN/PFL by the capacitors. A first FCC prototype IA, capable of generating 9 kV and 2.4 kA pulses, has been designed and built at CERN. It will be upgrade to a full-scale prototype (15 kV, 2.4 kA) in 2018. This paper presents measurement results from the 9 kV prototype and outlines the conceptual changes and expected performance of the 15 kV prototype."
