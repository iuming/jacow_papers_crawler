        "The European XFEL GmbH is a new X-ray FEL user facility and started lasing in 2017. Three gap movable SASE Undulator Systems are designed to produce FELs with tunable wavelengths from 0.05 to 5.2nm [*",
        "**]. A total of 91 5-m long undulator segments based on hybrid NdFeB permanent magnet technology were tuned respecting tight specifications. Radiation damage due to machine operation affects the magnetic properties of the segments and the quality of the SASE process. An array of dosimeters based on Radfets [***] and Gafchromic films monitors the absorbed doses in every undulator segment and each SASE system is equipped with a 12mm gap diagnostic undulator (DU) which is magnetically re-measured during machine maintenance weeks. Doses up to 4 kGy have been observed and magnetic field degradation higher than 3% is measured. These results permit to estimate the effects of radiation damage and life expectancy of the Undulator Systems based on the precise K-parameter determination for beam operation. We will present the results of magnetic re-measurements on the Undulator Systems",
