        "We present an update on the lattice design and beam dynamics study of the ion collider ring of JLEIC (Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider). The collider ring consists of two 261.7 degree arcs connected by two straight sections crossing each other. One of the straights houses an interaction region (IR) and is shaped to make a 50 mrad crossing angle with the electron beam at the interaction point (IP) to meet physics requirements. The forward acceptance requirements downstream of the IP in the ion direction lead to an asymmetric IR lattice design. The detector solenoid effects and the multipole fields of the IR magnets further complicate this picture. In this paper",
        "compensation of the detector solenoid effects is considered together with orbit correction and multipole effects. We also study local compensation of the magnet multipoles using dedicated multipole correctors. And an optimization of the betatron tunes is also presented."

The LIGHT accelerator consists of three different linac sections: a 750 MHz Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) accelerating the beam up to 5 MeV; a 3 GHz Side Coupled Drift Tube Linac (SCDTL) up to 37.5 MeV; and a 3 GHz Cell Coupled Linac (CCL) section up to 230 MeV. The compact and modular design is based on cutting edge technologies developed for particle colliders and adapted to the needs of hadron therapy beams. A prototype of LIGHT is presently under commissioning at CERN. This paper describes the design aspects and the different stages of installation and commissioning of the LIGHT prototype with emphasis on beam tests results obtained during the past year at different energies."

      "abstract": "Gantry 2 at PSI is a Pencil Beam Scanning (PBS) cyclotron based proton therapy system. PBS proved to be an effective treatment method for static tumors but for mobile targets (e.g lung) organ motion interferes with beam delivery lowering the treatment quality. A method to mitigate motion effects is to re-scan the treatment volume multiple times. The downside of re-scanning is the increase of treatment time due to high number of energy switches and magnet initializations (ramping) between scans. Our current re-scanning implementation is performed with a decreasing energy sequence and takes about 6s/scan thanks to fast energy switching of 100ms. Ramping adds 8s more leading to a treatment time of >60s. We developed beam line settings for reverse energy sequence and removed the full ramping between scans. This dynamic beam delivery leads to non-negligible beam position errors of >1.5mm which we compensate by field specific corrections. Using a patient file we proved that our novel re-scanning concept doubles the treatment efficiency. Using in-house developed measurement equipment we obtained a precision of <0.5mm in position and <1mm in range which fulfills all clinical requirements. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

      "abstract": "Continued research into the optimization of medical accelerators is urgently required to assure the best possible cancer care for patients and this is one of the central aims of the OMA project which received 4 M€ of funding from the European Commission. A consortium of universities, research and clinical facilities, as well as partners from industry carry out an interdisciplinary R&D program across three closely interlinked scientific work packages. These address the development of novel beam imaging and diagnostics systems, studies into treatment optimization including innovative schemes for beam delivery and enhanced biological and physical models in Monte Carlo codes, as well as R&D into clinical facility design and optimization to ensure optimum patient treatment along with maximum efficiency. Selected research highlights from across these work packages will be presented and the impact on hadron therapy facilities around the world discussed. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
