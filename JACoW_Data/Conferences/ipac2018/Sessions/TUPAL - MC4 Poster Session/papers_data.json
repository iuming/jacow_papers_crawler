The horizontal space for MEBT elements is limited because two beam lines merge at 18-degree angle. The MEBT design developed with envelope codes includes two compact quarter-wave RF bunchers and four short quadrupoles with steerers",

        "we calculate buncher RF fields and quadrupole magnetic fields and use them to perform particle-in-cell beam dynamics modeling of MEBT with realistic beam distributions from the RFQ. Our results indicate a significant emittance growth not predicted by standard beam dynamics codes. Its origin was traced mainly to the quadrupole edge fields. Quadrupole design modifications are proposed to improve the MEBT performance."

        "The Marburg Ion-Beam Therapy Centre offers hadron therapy using proton and carbon beams. The accelerator is based on a 65-m ion synchrotron by Danfysik/Siemens Healthcare. Beam extraction from the synchrotron is driven by a transverse RF knock-out (KO) system featuring Dynamic Intensity Control (DIC) of the spill. DIC allows modulation of the extraction rate by factors up to 30 on millisecond time scales. A fast response of the system to the variable intensity set-point can be obtained by careful adjustment of the RF-KO spectrum relative to the machine tune. Tracking simulations of the extraction phase have been conducted to refine that behaviour. Presently",

The first two phases associated with proof-of-principle and proof-of-practicality experiments have been successfully completed and demonstrated >95% H− stripping efficiency for up to 10 us. The final phase is a proof-of-scalability stage to demonstrate that the method can be deployed for realistic beam duty factors. The experimental component of this effort is centered on achieving high efficiency stripping through the use of a laser power amplification scheme to recycle the macropulse laser light at the interaction point of the H− stripping. Such a recycling cavity will be necessary for any future operational laser stripping system with at least millisecond duration H− pulses. A second component of the proof-of-scalability phase is to develop a conceptual design for a realistic laser stripping scheme. The status of these efforts and challenges associated with deploying the recycling cavity into the laser stripping experiment will be described in this talk."

        "an accumulated beam charge extracted with a single foil increased from ~60 mA·hours to more than 500 mA·hours. A key role that lead to these advances was an understanding of the foil heating mechanism",
        "major contribution to which is paid by the power deposition from electrons stripped by the foil. To further diminish this effect",
        "we recently introduced a foil tilt from the vertical orientation that allows stripped electrons fast escape from the foil",

Introduction of a \"combo\" foil consisting of wide portion and thin wire allowed both high and low intensity beam extraction without foils sacrifice. Deploying a wedge foil for extraction at 100 MeV helped reduction of beam intensity instabilities caused by beam vertical size and position fluctuations."
