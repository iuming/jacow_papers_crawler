        "A system to measure the full 6D beam parameters (not 3x2D) has been built at the SNS RFQ test stand. Such a measurement will allow detailed analysis of the beam physics from a properly measured input term. This invited provides an overview of the principles and design of this system",
        "and reports on status and results."

Existing phase space measurement methods are based on either average multiple shots of the full beam (e.g. scanning slit and quad scan tomography) or a single-shot sample of the beam (e.g. pepper pot and multi-slit). To achieve a single-shot measurement of the full beam",
        "we project the beam's x-coordinate to the y-coordinate and its x'-coordinate to the x-coordinate using a skew quadrupole magnet followed by a normal quadrupole magnet. We present a theoretical description of this projection scheme and a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration done at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility."
