        "This invited talk presents the most recent status of improving J-PARC main ring (MR) beam operation together with the rapid cycling synchrotron (RCS) effort. The RCS has optimized the beam performance for the MR injection as well as the muon and neutron targets",
        "where each requires different emittance and beam halo size. The MR has two extraction modes; fast extraction (FX) for the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment",
        "T2K",
        "and slow extraction (SX) for experiments in the hadron experimental facility. At present",
        "achieved beam intensities are 2.4·1014 protons per pulse (ppp) with cycle time 2.48 s (470 kW) in the FX mode and 5.1013 ppp with cycle time 5.52 s (44 kW) in the SX mode. For the FX operation",
        "recent improvements are settings of new betatron tune",
        "corrections of resonances near the betatron tune",
        "and adopting 2nd harmonic rf voltage to reduce space charge effect. Beam instabilities have been suppressed with controlling chromaticity correction and transverse feedback systems. For the SX mode",
        "a dynamic bump scheme for reducing extracted beam loss is successfully adopted. A high extraction efficiency of 99.5 % is achieved at the 44 kW beam operation."

        "ion beam contaminants extracted from the ECR ion source together with main ion beam can produce significant losses after the charge stripper. These studies resulted in development of beam collimation system at relatively low energy of 16 MeV/u and room temperature bunchers instead of originally planned superconducting ones. Commissioning of the Front End enabled detailed beam physics studies accompanied with the simulations using several beam dynamics codes. Settings of beam optics devices from the ECR to MEBT has been developed and applied to meet important project milestones. Similar work is planned for the beam commissioning of the first 3 cryomodules in the superconducting linac."
