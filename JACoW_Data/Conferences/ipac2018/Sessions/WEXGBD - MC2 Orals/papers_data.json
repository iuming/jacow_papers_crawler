        "Scientists and engineers at KEK have developed undulator magnets having very short period lengths. Magnet plates 100mm and 152mm long with 4-mm period length have been successfully fabricated. They produce an undulator field of approximately 4kG at a gap of 1.6mm. The magnetic field characterization shows that the undulator field is satisfactory in quality for a very short period undulator. KEK has recently installed a short-period undulator at a 50-MeV linac and observed a first light",
        "and will soon start an experiment using a short-period undulator with laser-accelerated electrons for future table-top XFELs. This invited talk summarizes the current status",
        "and experimental activities and results related to short-period undulators and table-top FELs."

        "The parallel operation of multiple beamlines is an important issue to expand the opportunity of user experiments for linac based FELs. At SACLA",
        "the parallel operation of three beamlines",
        "BL1~3",
        "has been open to user experiments since September 2017. BL1 is a soft x-ray beamline driven by a dedicated accelerator",
        "which is a former SCSS linac",
        "and BL2 and 3 are XFEL beamlines",
        "which share the electron beam from the SACLA main linac. In the parallel operation",
        "a kicker magnet with 10 ppm stability (peak-to-peak) switches the two XFEL beamlines at 60 Hz from pulse to pulse. To ensure wide spectral tunability and optimize the laser performance",
        "the energies and lengths of the electron bunches are independently adjusted for the two beamlines according to user experiments. Since the electron bunch of SACLA has typically 10~15 fs (FWHM) in length and its peak current exceeds 10 kA",
        "the CSR effect at a dogleg beam transport to BL2 is quite significant. In order to suppress the CSR effects",
        "an isochronous and achromatic lattice based on two DBA structures was introduced. In this talk",
        "the multiple XFEL beamline operation and achieved laser performance are presented."

        "Time-resolved experiments at the attosecond scale hold great promise for understanding ultrafast electron dynamics in molecules",
        "as well as the role of electron coherence in chemistry. In the recent past",
        "much progress has been made in using X-ray free-electron lasers (X-FELs) to visualize atomic motion at the tens of femtosecond scale. At the same time",
        "table-top lasers have been operated at the attosecond scale and successfully employed in scientific experiments. However",
        "the femtosecond barrier has not yet been broken at X-ray free-electron lasers",
        "hindering our ability to understand the fundamental motion of electrons. This invited talk describes the XLEAP project",
        "aimed at generating attosecond pulses in the soft-X-ray region at LCLS",
        "including the physics of laser-enhanced FELs and the effect of bandwidth broadening in this FEL mode. This talk will also present early XLEAP commissioning results and the immediate experimental plans",
        "and describe plans for the transition from FEL R&D to science and discuss the roadmap to attosecond science with LCLS-II."
