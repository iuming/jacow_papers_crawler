        "The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility has been devoting much effort to the fundamental R&D of two-beam acceleration (TBA) technology with two parallel L-band beam lines. Beginning from the 70 MeV drive beam line",
        "the high frequency (C-band and above) rf power is extracted from the beam by a decelerating structure (a.k.a. power extractor)",
        "transferred to an accelerating structure in the witness beam line",
        "and used to accelerate the 15 MeV main beam. These high frequency accelerating structures usually have a small aperture to obtain high gradient and high efficiency",
        "making it difficult for the low energy main beam to pass. To address this issue",
        "one proposal is to increase the main beam energy to above 30 MeV by replacing the current witness linac. A 9-cell 𝜋-mode L-band standing-wave accelerating structure has therefore been designed to meet the high shunt impedance and low cost requirements. In addition",
        "the single-feed coupling cell has been optimized with additional symmetrical ports to eliminate field distortion. The detailed design of the new accelerating structure will be presented in this paper."

        "the 100 MeV proton linac is operational with a 2 ms long pulsed proton injector",
        "i.e. a microwave ion source. We will upgrade our injector by combining the already existing microwave ion source with a EBIS-SC (Superconducting Electron Beam Ion Source from Dreebit GmbH) for short pulses (< 1 us) of proton. This planned injector will work one at the time and provide long/short pulses of accelerated proton hitting a target to emit correspondingly long/short neutron pulses. Main modification on the proton injector is the EBIS-SC",

        "Geant4 physical processes for simulating diffusion and effusion of radioactive ions in matter have been developed for optimizing ISOL target-ion-source (TIS) system. The developed processes simulate motions of radioactive ions with sub-eV kinetic energy in the TIS geometry. The processes consist of diffusion",

The diffusion probability is analytically calculated by using the well-known Fick's formula. The effusive flow of neutral atoms is interpreted in terms of kinetic molecular theory of gases",
        "where the interaction between atoms and the wall of a target container is described by employing Lorentz-Lambert model. By the help of newly implemented processes",

The former approach relies on software synchronization and tango device servers to execute a series of DC corrector magnets and quadrupoles settings designed to avoid the quadrupole hysteresis effects. The approach that we present here is simpler",
