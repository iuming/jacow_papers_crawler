        "a new radiation-robust hadron beam profile monitor has been proposed consisting of an interface of gas-filled radiofrequency cavity detectors in the backward region of the LBNF decay pipe. A tailored monitor layout will be used along with the new RF instrumentation. Proposed designs for the detector configuration include a variety of radially symmetric arrangements of RF resonators located at the position of maximum gradient in the beam distribution across the monitor. Until the final detector cavities are available",
        "a prototype tunable Q-factor RF cavity will provide functional emulation for studies of the monitor layout configurations presented here."

        "the Recycler or the Main Injector. Often the orbit of the beam through the MI8 line differs depending on the beam destination. The beam is collimated in the MI8 line",
        "so increasing intensities and repetition rates make controlling orbits through the collimators a necessity. The current method of regulating the MI8 line orbit with DC corrector settings is insufficient. A system named MITUNE is being developed to sample and categorize all beams through the MI8 line and automatically calculate and apply proper dipole corrector ramps to maintain desired orbits for pulses to any destination."
