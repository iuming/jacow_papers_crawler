        "following the promising results of the first tests with single multipole kicker injection at other light sources",
        "studies to implement this new injection scheme have been started for ALBA. Two possible designs for the kicker have been considered: a pure octupole and a non-linear magnet similar to the BESSY type. A comparison between the expected performances of the two kicker designs has been carried out in terms of injection efficiency and transparency for the users. This paper summarises the beam dynamics results from multi-particle tracking simulations and the proposed kicker magnet design."

        "is typically below 0.1% for most of the x-FEL facilities presently in operation. Undulator tapering techniques can be used to improve the conversion efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However at present there are no robust tapered undulator x-FEL schemes operating at 10% efficiency. In this paper we report on the development of tapered radiofrequency (RF) undulator. An RF undulator is a microwave waveguide in which strong RF field is excited that interacts with a charged particle beam forcing it to radiate coherent x-rays while undergoing a wiggling motion. RF undulators are attractive for use in x-FELs due to their large beam aperture and a short undulator period. Strongly tapered RF undulators (with tapering of a wavelength) due to non-resonant trapping regime allow keeping high overall XFEL efficiency being driven by laser plasma accelerated beams usually having high enough current but large energy spread (1-10%)."

        "The second version of the superconducting RF pho-toinjector (SRF Gun II) was successfully commissioned at the ELBE radiation source in 2014. The gun features an improved 3.5-cell niobium cavity combined with a super-conducting solenoid integrated in the cryostat. With a Mg photocathode the SRF Gun II is able to generate bunches with up to 200 pC and with sub-ps length in CW mode with 100 kHz pulse frequency for the THz radiation fa-cility at ELBE. In the ELBE linac",

This will become crucial especially in future light sources where narrow gap in-vacuum IDs are normally used. While the Touschek scattered electron begins to oscillate in the horizontal direction with the amplitude proportional to the dispersion at the scattering point and to the momentum deviation after scattering",
        "the motion is converted into the vertical direction due to the betatron coupling and some of the scattered electrons are lost at the narrow gaps of in-vacuum IDs. The momentum deviation by the Touschek scattering reaches 5% more",

We carried out computer simulations by taking the present SPring-8 storage ring and a planned 3GeV low-emittance ring as examples. The results and possible measures for ID protection will be presented."

      "abstract": "Proper alignment of accelerating cavities is an important issue concerning beam quality of accelerators. In particular SRF cavities of injector linacs using high accelerating gradients on low beta electron beams can affect the beam quality significantly when not aligned perfectly. On the other hand knowing the exact position of every cavity after several cool-down cycles of a cryomodule can be difficult depending on the cryomodule design. We will report on operational experience on the SC injector of the Darmstadt superconducting linac and ERL (S-DALINAC) showing unexpected effects on beam dynamics and beam quality. Operators could observe transverse beam deflections by changing accelerating phases of the injector SRF-cavities while a growth of tranverse emittance occurred at the same time. As beam currents in the S-DALINAC injector do never exceed 100 μA and the effects could even be observed at nA beam currents space-charge effects could be eliminated to be the reason for these observations. In this work we will report on the possibility to align SRF cavities after cooldown by measuring the transverse deflection of the beam and compare results with beam dynamics simulations. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",
