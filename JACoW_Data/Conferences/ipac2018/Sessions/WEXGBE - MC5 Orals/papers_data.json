        "which nowadays is standard for lepton colliders and synchrotron light sources",
        "has been developed over last decades. The accelerator performances have been drastically improved through top-up operation. However",
        "future electron storage rings are designed",
        "aiming at further high performance",
        "to operate with strong nonlinear magnetic fields that may restrict their dynamic aperture. Consequently",
        "the conventional off-axis injection and accumulation may become impossible. New injection schemes have been proposed and under development to overcome the difficulties and limitations expected in these machines. This paper reviews top-up injection schemes",
        "including novel ideas recently proposed."

        "Intrabeam Scattering (IBS) effects will become a limiting factor for the attainable emittances and single-bunch currents in future electron storage rings and light sources. IBS studies were performed for BESSY II at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and for the Metrology Light Source (MLS) at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) to quantify the IBS contributions to equilibrium beam sizes in these machines and make predictions for the BESSY II upgrade project",
        "BESSY VSR. The energy dependence of IBS effects (γ −4 ) makes especially the MLS machine susceptible to IBS effects due to the relatively low energy ranges at which it can be operated (50 MeV-630 MeV). We compare experimental data with simulations and present IBS simulation results for BESSY VSR."
