The TR24 is a separated-sector isochronous cyclotron with normal-conducting magnet and stripper foil. It is a challenge to fit the high intensity proton beam used for target irradiation to radiobiology and analytical applications due to requirements on beam quality and energy resolution. Field distribution in the region of the extraction performed with OPERA 3D as well as beam dynamics related with stripping are analysed. 3D calculation model and hypothesis about geometry and beam are described. Our goal is to evaluate the extraction efficiency and the beam characteristics in the focusing plane outside the cyclotron which will serve as inputs for the design of future beam lines and enable beam matching conditions.

The linac could provide a number of positrons as high as 109/pulse in a 200 ns pulse but the number of positrons for PADME is limited below 105/pulse in order to keep the pile-up probability in the calorimeter low enough. The PADME experiment is indeed limited by the low duty factor (10e-5=200ns/20ms). An alternative proposal to use the DAΦNE positron ring as a linac pulse stretcher",

A dedicate lattice for the ring has been designed and tracking of the positrons in the ring has been performed to optimize extraction parameters and give a preliminary estimate of the extracted beam characteristics.",

The 800-MeV beam is transported through a beam line containing many bending and focusing elements before it reaches the pRad beam optics system where the beam spot size requirement is nominally 2 mm (RMS). Here we discuss the efforts to reconcile the beam transport inconsistencies (sizes) seen between comparisons of the beam sizes obtained using the LANL version of the beam envelope code TRANSPORT with those measured along the beam line. The transverse input beam parameters for the code were extracted from a fit to several wire-scanner measurements located in the downstream portion of the LINAC. The longitudinal input beam parameters were extrapolated from lower-energy information. Recently",

        "The interaction of relativistic electrons with periodic structures results in radiation by a number of mechanisms. In case of crystals one obtains parametric X-ray radiation",
        "its frequency is determined by distance between crystallographic planes and direction of electron beam. If instead of crystal one considers a periodic structure of metallic wires with period of the order of mm",
        "one can expect emission of THz radiation. In the present contribution we consider theoretical approaches for modeling of the distribution of electromagnetic field from electron bunches in lattice formed by metallic wires. The analytical description is possible for the case of wires with small radius",
        "the range of validity is checked by numerical simulations. The intensity of radiation will be significantly increased if the electrons in the bunch could radiate coherently. Two possibilities will be discussed: the prebunching of the beam and the self-modulation of the beam due to interaction with radiated field."

        "The Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) is being commissioned at Fermi National Laboratory for study of the concept of nonlinear integrable optics. The use of a special nonlinear magnetic element introduces large tune spread with amplitude while constraining the idealized dynamics by two integrals of motion. The nonlinear element should provide suppression of instabilities through nonlinear decoherence. We examine the case of a bunch injected off-axis and the resulting damping of centroid oscillations from decoherence. A simple model of the damping is described and compared to simulation."

        "respectively. The high field gradient is attained from an offset quadrupole design pioneered by the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The prototype magnet is fabricated and tested in-house. Magnetic field quality is characterized by the field homogeneity in the central field region and multipole components of the magnetic field. Calculated results show that the gradient deviation and the normalized multipole error are less than 0.01 within the good field region of ±8 mm. Preliminary measurements show a good agreement with the calculation",

A practical self-consistent approach was developed to obtain an effective wake function from a numerical wake potential computed for a finite length bunch.

The decomposed impedance is then transformed back into time domain and",

Multi-stage bunch compression schemes have been identified as a possible source of such an instability. The dispersive sections in these compressors translate energy inhomogeneities within the bunch into longitudinal charge density inhomogeneities. In conjunction with a collective force driving locally density-dependent energy modulations this leads to intricate longitudinal beam dynamics. As a consequence of the thin shape those bunches form in the longitudinal phase space",
