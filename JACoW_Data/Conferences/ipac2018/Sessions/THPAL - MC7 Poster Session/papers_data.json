        "especially for extra beam power and detuning angle. The current was increased gradually resulting in more and more frequency detuning",
        "and an effective method is to tune the temperature of cavity to compromise detuning. Of course",
        "the power dissipated in cavity and high intensity beam are approximately 120kW resulting in too many power modules operated in the high risk of failure. The specific analysis and simulation were introduced in detail."

      "abstract": "The R&D of high gradient radiofrequency (RF) devices is aimed to develop innovative accelerating structures based on new manufacturing techniques and materials in order to construct devices operating with the highest accelerating gradient. Recent studies have shown a large increase in the maximum sustained RF surface electric fields in copper structures operating at cryogenic temperatures. These novel approaches allow significant performance improvements of RF photoinjectors. Indeed the operation at high surface fields results in considerable increase of electron beam brilliance. This increased brilliance requires high field quality in the RF photoinjector and specifically in its power coupler. In this work we present a novel power coupler for the RF photoinjector. The coupler is a compact X-band TM01 mode launcher with a fourfold symmetry which minimized both the dipole and the quadrupole RF components. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

        "and the feedback has this far been provided in all three planes by a single stripline kicker. This is done by combining the horizontal and vertical baseband feedback signals with the longitudinal feedback signal that is upconverted to the 150 MHz - 250 MHz range. The combined signal is then fed to two stripline electrodes. The layout of the BBB feedback system in the MAX IV 1.5 GeV ring is presented in this paper.

The choice of the materials for the rare elements alloy accelerator magnets has the decisive importance for the long term magnet parameters keeping. The experimental studies of the magnetic fields around the Nd-Fe-B and Sm2Co17 alloy magnets under effect of the electron beam have been done. The samples of 30х24х12 mm geometrical sizes were bombarded by electron beam of applied NSC KIPT accelerator KUT-1 with electron energy of 10 MeV and were irradiated by correspondent bremsstrahlung. The magnetic field value around Nd-Fe-B alloy samples was decreased nonlineary under electron beam bombarding with change of irradiation doze from 16 to 160 GRad. Under effect of bremsstrahlung the magnetic field value around samples was not changed. The repeated sample magnetizations allowed to restore the initial magnetic field distribution around magnets. The magnetic field distribution around Sm2Co17 alloy samples was not changed under effect of the electron beam and bremsstrahlung within irradiation dozes mentioned above. The induced activity in the Nd-Fe-B and Sm2Co17 alloy samples was changed slightly during the experiments. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

One is a 10.156 MHz buncher used in the low energy beam transport (LEBT) line to longitudinally focus the 50 keV deuteron beam to the RFQ longitudinal acceptance with 4 kV effective voltage. A lumped element model is adopted because of the low frequency and it consists of an inductance coil in parallel with the capacitance of drift tube. The other one is an 81.25 MHz buncher used in the high energy beam transport (HEBT) line to longitudinally focus the 5 MeV deuteron beam to 2 ns. A QWR cavity with 2-gaps is used to provide 150 kV effective voltage. Thermal and structural analyses have been carried out on these two bunchers.

        "our aim is to optimize the cavity geometry to maximize performance with current materials. The recent demonstration of a highly efficient parallel-feed NCRF structure at SLAC has served as a proof-of-concept. Applied to SRF",
        "such a structure could dramatically reduce power consumption while boosting the achievable gradient. Instead of coupled elliptical cells",
        "our structure employs isolated reentrant cells. To feed RF power to the cavities",
        "each cell is directly coupled to an integrated manifold. The structure is made in two parts",
        "split along the beam axis",
        "which are then joined. Such a structure has been fabricated from bulk Cu and tested at SLAC - designed for X-band",
        "it operates at a record gradient of 150 MV/m. Adapting to SRF at 1.3 GHz and fabricating from Nb",
        "such a cavity could achieve more than 50% lower RF loss and 40% higher gradient compared to the TESLA cavity. We will describe our simulations and propose an experimental roadmap for demonstrating this technology."

The main aim of this study was to establish a procedure to prepare the Cu surface prior to installation so a Quantum Efficiency (QE) of 10-5 or higher can be achieved at laser power density below the ablation threshold of copper. The best results have been obtained by ex-situ chemical cleaning. This removed the surface oxide layer whilst at the same time producing a surface buffer layer. This inhibited the regrowth of native oxide for up to a week when exposed to normal ambient atmospheric conditions. With either chemical cleaning or Ar plasma cleaning after heating the sample in-situ to 150 °C for 90 minutes or 250 °C for 40 hours",

Single metal Zr coatings have been tested to find a more efficient and cheaper way of producing the NEG-coated vacuum chambers. Two samples coated with Zr of dense and columnar structure were analysed and results of the pumping properties are reported. The results show that pure Zr coating could be an economic solution",

A pulsed drift tube (PDT) will adjust the energy of the bunched beam for injection into the EBIS to match the acceptance of the post-accelerating RFQ. Ion optical simulations were carried out to inform the design of the RFQ buncher and PDT. Simulations indicate that delivery of up to 107~ions per bunch with high efficiency is possible. Experience with previous beam bunchers was also brought to bear in the design effort. Installation of the RFQ is under way",

One direction of search for new materials with better properties is the modification of bulk niobium by nitrogen doping. In the Nb-N phase diagram the cubic delta-phase of NbN has the highest critical temperature (16 K). Already slight nitrogen doping of the alpha-Nb phase results in higher quality factors.* Nb samples were N-doped at the refurbished UHV furnace at IKP Darmstadt. Reference samples were annealed in 1 bar nitrogen atmosphere at different temperatures. In this contribution the results on the structural investigations (x-ray diffraction and pole figure",

        "especially the TM11-like mode were investigated for the linacs both in travelling wave and backward trav-elling wave. Measurements of beam-break up in a travel-ling wave linac were carried out and results are discussed. Moreover",
        "a theoretical model was developed for the irradiation linacs to study the detailed interaction be-tween the transverse wakefield and the electron beam."
