The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility is developing a dielectric-based short pulse TBA scheme with the potential to withstand high acceleration gradients and to achieve low fabrication cost. Recently",
        "the dielectric short pulse TBA technology was successfully demonstrated using K-band 26 GHz structures",
        "achieving 55 MW output power from the power extractor and 28 MeV/m gradient in the accelerator. To improve the generated rf power",

        "which obtained 105 MW in the high power test. In addition",
        "a novel dielectric disk accelerator (DDA) is currently under investigation to significantly increase the efficiency of linear colliders based on short pulse TBA. Details of these research will be presented in this paper."

The use of the high brightness primary proton source resulted in higher polarized beam intensity and polarization delivered for injection to Linac-Booster-AGS-RHIC accelerator complex. The proposed polarized 3He++ acceleration in RHIC and future electron- ion col-lider (eRHIC) will require about 2·1011 ions in the source pulse. A new technique had been proposed for production of high intensity polarized 3He++ ion beam. It is based on ionization and accumulation of the 3He gas (polarized by optical-pumping and metastability-exchange technique in the high magnetic field of a 5.0 T) in the Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS). We present a status of the 3He++ ion source development.",
