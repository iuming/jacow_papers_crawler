The first phase was successfully completed in 2016; focusing on vacuum scrubbing and single beam studies without final focus optics. The second phase will start in March 2018 and until mid of July 2018. It will be dedicated to achieving the target specific luminosity larger than 4x1031 cm-2s-1/mA2; using the novel ""nano-beam"" collision scheme. Final focus optics will be installed; as well as the Belle-II detector; but without the vertex detector. The second phase of commissioning will also serve to assess and learn to control backgrounds induced by beam losses near the interaction region; expected to be larger than at KEKB in the past; as a result of the much smaller beams. This will be important before installing the vertex detector for the final phase of commissioning; due to start at the beginning of 2019; when high luminosity needed for data taking with the Belle-II detector should be achieved. The speaker will present the recent progress and performance of SuperKEKB that is enabled by these upgrades.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/moxgb1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/moxgb1.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/moxgb1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOXGB1,1

The trapping of anti-hydrogen atoms and more recently lead-lead and proton-lead ion collisions in the LHC have been made possible thanks to cooling in the AD and cooling and accumulation of lead ions in the LEIR respectively.

The filling from zero current occurs in collision to profit from the bunch lengthening due to beamstrahlung (so-called bootstrapping). At any time when new e- and e+ buckets or bunchlets are injected into the collider; they will collide instantly. For this reason; we may provide the charge in each injected bunch in a way to pre-compensate for anticipated beam loss; and to reach the target luminosity as soon as possible after the first injection. In this way; we optimise the injection schedules for Z-mode so as to reach the peak luminosity in less than 20 minutes by interleaved injection of the two species at some portion of full bucket charge. Filling from zero the injector should allow accumulating 1.7·1011 particles in one collider bucket within at least 10 injections; assuming a total transmission above 80%. In steady-state operation; the injector chain continually produces and accelerates lower bunch charges so as to maintain nearly constant bunch currents and constant peak luminosity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF001,79

It is also shown that a minimum number of tracking turns is required in order to ensure the numerical convergence of the linear regressions that yield depolarizing time constant values from tracking; in both methods.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF014,112

To cope with the increased beam current (0.55 A DC for LHC; 1.1 A for HL-LHC); the operation of the LLRF system has been changed: rather than fully compensating the transient beam loading; we allow the phase to vary along the turn (100 ps peak-peak with 1.1 A DC). This has been implemented at LHC since July 2017. The CCs have high loaded Q (5e5) and the available RF power is insufficient to follow the bunch phase modulation. The crabbing voltage is not modulated; causing a phase error w.r.t. the individual bunch centroids; leading to transverse kicks of the centroids and an asymmetric crabbing of the bunch cores. We present an analytical model for the resulting luminosity reduction and validate with particle tracking simulations. Due to the symmetry of the bunch filling patterns for the counter-rotating beams; the peak luminosity is reduced by only 2% for nominal HL-LHC parameters at IPs 1 and 5; which is within tolerable limits.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf022.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF022,129

The standard technique starts with making a guess for \bfn(\bfr); which is a function of the phase space position \bfr. By tracking a particle's orbital position forward in time and then projecting the guessed \bfn backwards to the starting phase space point; the average of the backward projected spins will converge to the invariant spin direction linearly as 1/N where N is the number of turns tracked. The convergence can be accelerated by an iterative method that uses an approximate invariant spin field constructed by averaging the calculated spin field over points that are close in orbital phase space.

It is found that the Pre-isolator required for stabilization of the Final Doublet drives the performance of the collider at the final stages of the tuning process. The obtained tuning performance depending on the stabilization techniques are discussed in detail. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF043,196

The numerical assessment requires an iterative execution of an energy-deposition code and a hydrodynamic code; since the hydrodynamic tunneling effect will likely play an important role in the beam-matter interactions. For proton accelerators at CERN and for the Future Circular Collider (FCC); case studies were performed; coupling FLUKA and BIG2. To compare different hydrocodes and not to rely only on BIG2; FLUKA and a commercial tool; Autodyn; have been used to perform these simulations. This paper reports a benchmarking study against a beam test performed at the HiRadMat (High-Radiation to Materials) facility using beams at 440 GeV from the Super Proton Synchrotron. Good agreement has been found between the simulation results and the test as well as previous simulations with FLUKA and BIG2; particularly in terms of penetration depth of the beam in copper. This makes the coupling of FLUKA and Autodyn an alternative solution to simulating the hydrodynamic tunneling. More case studies are planned for FCC and other high-beam-power accelerators.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf046.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF046,204

The standard method used in the LHC commissioning requires using several bunches for one measurement and makes bunches un-usable for other activities. This paper presents first global aperture measurements performed at injection with a new method using the AC dipole. This method consists in exciting large coherent oscillations of the beam without spoiling its emittance. A gentle control of the oscillation amplitude enables re-using the beams for several measurements.

In August; several machine parameters had to be re-tuned to mitigate beam loss induced instabilities and maintain a steady increase of the instantaneous luminosity. The use of a novel beam type and filling pattern produced in the injectors; allowed filling the machine with very low emittance beam (1.5 um) achieving an equivalent luminosity with 1868 bunches. In September; the beta-star was further lowered to 30 cm (using; for the first time; the telescopic technique of the ATS) and the bunch intensity pushed to 1.25·1011 protons.

Then; it was possible to increase safely the centre of mass energy to 13 TeV. During the training campaigns; metallic debris caused short circuits in the dipole diode containers; leading to an unacceptable risk. Major interventions can only take place during multiyear shutdowns. To ensure safe operation at higher energies; hence requiring further magnets training; the electrical insulation of the 1232 dipole diodes bus-bars will be consolidated during the second LHC long shutdown (LS2) in 2019-20. The design of the reinforced electrical insulation of the dipole cold diodes and the associated project organisation are presented; including the validation tests; especially at cryogenics temperature.

The implications as well as possible mitigations and upgrade measures for the dilution system; such as decreasing the pulse-generator voltage; adding two additional kickers; and implementing a retrigger system; are discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF062,261

An asynchronous beam dump is provoked when the rise time of the extraction kickers is not synchronized to the 3 us long particle-free abort gap. Thus; particles that are not absorbed by dedicated protection elements can be lost on the machine aperture. Since asynchronous beam dumps are among the most critical failure cases of the LHC; experimental tests at low intensity are performed routinely. This paper reviews recent asynchronous beam dump tests performed in the LHC. It describes the test conditions; discusses the beam-loss behaviour and presents simulation and measurement results. In particular; it examines a test event from May 2016; which led to the quench of four superconducting magnets in the extraction region and which was studied by a dedicated beam experiment in December 2017.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf063_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf063.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf063_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF063,265

ipac2018,,MOPMF065,LHC- and FCC-Based Muon Colliders,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; In recent years; three schemes for producing low-emittance muon beams have been proposed: (1) e+e− annihilation above threshold using a positron storage ring with a thin target [M. Boscolo; P. Raimondi et al.]; (2) laser/FEL-Compton back-scattering off high-energy proton beams circulating in the LHC or FCC-hh [L.

The Gamma factory would also generate copious amounts of positrons which could in turn be used as source for option (1). On the other hand the top-up booster of the FCC-ee design would be an outstanding e+ storage ring; at the right beam energy; around 45 GeV.

The required higher dipole field can be realized by using 16-T dipoles being developed for the FCC-hh design. A major concern is the dynamic aperture at injection energy due to degraded field quality of the new dipole based on Nb3Sn superconductor; the potentially large energy swing between injection and collision; and the slightly reduced magnet aperture. Another issue is the field in quadrupoles and sextupoles at top energy; for which it may be cost-effective; wherever possible; to stay with Nb-Ti technology.

In the classical regime; for a constant electromagnetic field a simple relation exists between the average photon energy u and the average squared photon energy u2; which is the same as for standard synchrotron radiation in storage rings. This relation breaks down; however; if the electromagnetic field is not constant in time and position; as is the case for a beam-beam collision. We derive an analytical expression for u2/u2; considering the case of Gaussian-bunch collisions with crossing angle (and possibly crab waist). We compare our result with the photon energies obtained in beam-beam simulation for FCC-ee at beam energies of 45.6 GeV and 175 GeV; using the two independent codes BBWS and Guineapig. Finally; we re-optimize the FCC-ee parameters of a possible mono-chromatization scheme for direct Higgs production at 125 GeV; derived previously; by applying the refined expression for the rms photon energy.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf068_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf068.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf068_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF068,281

SuperKEKB energy-asymmetric electron-positron collider with its extremely high luminosity requires a high current; low emittance and low energy spread injection beam from the injector. The electron beam is generated by a new type of RF gun; that provides a much higher beam current to correspond to a large stored beam current and a short lifetime in the ring.

The macro-pulse contains 2 to 8 mini-trains with several train gaps; because the pulse format is a copy of a part of the bunch storage pattern in DR (Damping Ring). This pulse format causes a variation of the accelerator field in the pulse due to the transient beam loading and an intensity fluctuation of captured positron.

The method is based on the identification of Bhabha scattering events at low polar angle (∼10 degree) around the beam axis by using two small crystal calorimeters shared with the KLOE-2 experiment. A new experimental setup has been designed and realized in order to implement the fast luminosity monitor; also in view of the DAΦNE future physics runs. Besides total instantaneous luminosity the new diagnostic measures also Bunch-by-Bunch (BBB) luminosity. This peculiarity allows to investigate the beam-beam interaction for the Crab- Waist collisions at DAΦNE and luminosity dependence on the bunch train structure.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopmf089_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopmf089.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopmf089_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPMF089,338

In ion operation the cleaning efficiency of the collimation system is lower than in the case of protons and the ion showering process is more complicated and produces a larger variety of secondary particles. In particular; lighter ion species can be produced as fragmentation products in the collimation system and specialised physics lists are required to simulate their production and propagation in matter. The Geant4 toolkit offers comprehensive physics process lists that extend to the case of arbitrary ion species at high energies. First results from a study of ion collimation for the LHC using the Geant4 physics library in BDSIM are presented here.

The high-energy storage ring; operating at a momentum of up to 100 GeV/nucleon; requires novel use of bunched-beam cooling. We will present a new design for a Circulator Cooler Ring for bunched-beam electron cooling. This requires the generation and transport of very high-charge magnetized bunches; acceleration of the bunches in an energy recovery linac; and transfer of these bunches to a circulating ring that passes the bunches 11 times through the proton or ion beam inside cooling solenoids.

The induced turn-periodic transient in the cavity voltage modulates longitudinal beam properties along the train; such as synchronous position and bunch length. In the EIC design; due to the asymmetric bunch train structure between the electron and the ion beam; such modulation results in shifting collision point and leads to reduced luminosity. We have carried out the beam based experiments at BEPC-II and ALS using bunch-by-bunch diagnostic capabilities of the coupled-bunch feedback systems to study this transient effect.

Electron cooling is essential for JLEIC to overcome the intrabeam scattering effect; reduce the ion beam emittance and thus achieve the high luminosity. The cooling time is approximately in proportion to the square of the energy and the 6D emittance. To avoid the difficulty of cooling the ion beam with large emittance at high energy; a multi-stage cooing scheme was designed for JLEIC. The ion beam was cooled at the low energy to reduce the emittance. Then it was ramped up to the collision energy. During the collision; electron cooling is implemented to maintain the emittance and the luminosity.

One type is referred to as the local scheme; as it is approximately one kilometer shorter and corrects the chromaticity in both planes. The other type is referred to as the traditional scheme; and separates the chromaticity correction of each plane into different areas. The expectation early in the studies was that the traditional scheme would be easier to tune.

According to molecular dynamics calculations; the local temperature of the colliding cluster and the surface of the target are expected to increase to several thousand K. The enhancement of the chemical interactions between the molecules in the colliding clusters and the atoms on the target surface is expected; if polyatomic molecules; such as ethanol and acetone; are used for the source material of the cluster. So; the irradiation effects of the polyatomic liquid cluster ion beams on transition metal films have been studied to examine the possibility of utilizing the liquid cluster ion beam technique for the processing of transition metal films. The transition metal films were formed by magnetron sputtering. The liquid clusters were produced by the adiabatic expansion method and ionized by electron ionization. The sputtering yields of transition metal films induced by liquid cluster ions are discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopml011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopml011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopml011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPML011,415

In this configuration; the beam is de-squeezed (the \beta-function at the collision point is increased) in order to minimize the divergence for measurements at very small scattering angles. In these low beam intensity runs; it is important to place the Roman Pots (RPs) as close as possible to the beam; which demands special collimator settings. During Run I; a significant amount of background was observed in the forward detectors due to particles outscattered from the primary collimator. During Run II; a different collimation configuration was used where a tungsten collimator was used as primary collimator instead of the usual one made of carbon. Using this configuration; a significant reduction of the background at the RPs was observed.

This report reviews the basic muon production concepts as studied and operationally implemented at TRIUMF; PSI; and RAL and their application in the context of the MTA facility. Two scenarios were determined feasible.

In order to downsize accelerator with above merit; we suggested smaller variable energy accelerator which have cotangential trajectories. This new type accelerator is expected to realize variability of beam energy with static main magnetic field. One of technological problems of this new type accelerator is stability of betatron oscillation. We plan to utilize week focusing field as main magnetic field; which is decreasing on the radial direction outward and uniform in longitudinal direction; of this new type accelerator.

For estimation of damage such as target material used at the facility; displacement per atom (DPA); calculated by the particle flux multiplied displacement cross-section with cascade mode; is widely employed as an index of the damage. Although the DPA is employed as the standard; the experimental data of displacement cross-section are scarce for a proton in the energy region above 20 MeV. A recent study reports that the displacement cross section of tungsten has 8 times difference among the calculation models. Therefore; experimental data of the displacement cross-section is crucial. The displacement cross-section can be obtained by observing the change of resistivity of the sample cooled by GM cooler to sustain the damage. The sample is placed in the vacuum chamber placed at upstream of the beam dump for 3 GeV and 30 GeV synchrotrons in J-PARC; where the sample will be irradiated by the proton in the energy range between 0.4 and 30 GeV.

The isolated measurement of Delbrück scattering has not been performed because of interference with other elastic scattering processes. It was recently discovered that; using linearly polarized photons; Delbrück scattering can be measured nearly independently of the other scattering processes*. In order to perform a proof of principle experiment; a quasi-monochromatic gamma-ray beam with a maximum photon energy of 1 MeV has been generated at the UVSOR facility by colliding a CO2 laser with a 750-MeV electron beam. A preliminary experiment has been performed with 0.5-W laser power and 1-mA electron beam current. As a result; the measured gamma-ray flux was evaluated as 0.0006 photon/eV/mA/W/s around the peak energy of 1 MeV. If we accept 20 percent energy spread; in case of a 100-W CO2 laser colliding with a 300 mA electron beam; approximately 4 x 106-photons/s gamma-rays could be obtained.

The K6 comparison was done; the results reported as ratios of the NIM and the BIPM evaluations (and with the combined standard uncertainties given in parentheses); are 0.9917(60) at 6 MV; and 0.9941(59) at 10 MV. The quality correction factor KQ of usual used chamber was measure directly; and it is 0.3%~0.7% smaller than the data in the IAEA TRS-398 report. The typical chamber-to-chamber variations of the dose obtained with the IAEA TRS-277; TRS-398 and AAPM TG-51 were between 0.2% and 1.0% for the different photon beams. The variations of the dose obtained with IAEA TRS-398 and chambers calibrated directly by megavoltage photons were between 0.1% to 0.8%.

PBS proved to be an effective treatment method for static tumors but for mobile targets (e.g lung) organ motion interferes with beam delivery lowering the treatment quality. A method to mitigate motion effects is to re-scan the treatment volume multiple times. The downside of re-scanning is the increase of treatment time due to high number of energy switches and magnet initializations (ramping) between scans. Our current re-scanning implementation is performed with a decreasing energy sequence and takes about 6s/scan thanks to fast energy switching of 100ms. Ramping adds 8s more leading to a treatment time of >60s. We developed beam line settings for reverse energy sequence and removed the full ramping between scans. This dynamic beam delivery leads to non-negligible beam position errors of >1.5mm which we compensate by field specific corrections. Using a patient file we proved that our novel re-scanning concept doubles the treatment efficiency. Using in-house developed measurement equipment we obtained a precision of <0.5mm in position and <1mm in range which fulfills all clinical requirements. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopml059_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopml059.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopml059_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPML059,540

The steady-state dynamics of a TEC are a function of the emission characteristics of the cathode and anode; an array of intra-gap electrodes and dielectric structures; and the self-consistent dynamics of the electrons in the gap. Proper modeling of these devices requires self-consistent simulation of the electron interactions in the gap. We present results from simulations of these devices using the particle-in-cell code Warp; developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We consider the role of individual energy loss mechanisms in reducing device efficiency; including kinetic losses; radiative losses; and dielectric charging. We discuss the implementation of an external circuit model to provide realistic feedback. Lastly; we illustrate the potential to use nonlinear optimization to maximize the efficiency of these devices by examining grid transparency.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/mopml060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/mopml060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/mopml060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-MOPML060,543

A stationary proton beam of 2 MeV with a current of up to 5 mA was obtained in the accelerator. Neutron generation was performed and the flux and neutron spectrum were experimentally measured. A Beam Shaping Assembly was developed and manufactured; which makes it possible to form a therapeutic beam of neutrons to the greatest extent satisfying the requirements of BNCT. It was established that neutron irradiation of tumor cells of human glioma U251 and human glioblastoma T98G; previously incubated in a medium with boron; led to a significant suppression of their viability. Irradiation of mice with grafted human glioblastoma tumor led to their complete cure. In order to increase the beam parameters; the facility was equipped with a wire scanner OWS-30 (D-Pace; Canada; under the license of TRIUMF); a non-contact current sensor NPTC (Bergos; France); a FLIR T650SC infrared camera; an Optris CT Laser 3ML SF pyrometer (Optris; GmbH; Germany); cooled diaphragms with thermistors; telescopic beam receivers with thermoresistors; a new bushing insulator.

Such high-brightness electron beams are capable of providing 100-fs level temporal resolution and sub-Angstrom level spatial resolution to capture the ultrafast structural dynamics from photoexcited gas molecules. To experimentally demonstrate such an ultrafast electron scattering instrument; a high performance UGED system has been commissioned at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. The UGED instrument produces 3.7 MeV electron beams with 2 fC beam charge at 180-Hz repetition rate. The temporal resolution is characterized to be 150 fs full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM); while the spatial resolution is measured to be 0.76 Å FWHM. The UGED instrument also demonstrates outstanding performance in vacuum; rf; and electron beam pointing stability.

The experiments were performed at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility using its unique configuration of a PC rf gun injecting beam into two separated 9-cell cavities in series with corrector magnets and beam position monitors (BPMs) located before; between; and after them. The ~100-kHz oscillations with up to 300-μm amplitudes at downstream locations were observed in a 3-MHz micropulse repetition rate beam with charges of 500 and 1000 pC/b; although the effects were much reduced at 100 pC/b. The studies were based on HOM detector circuitry targeting the first and second dipole passbands; rf BPM bunch-by-bunch data; and imaging cameras viewing multi-slit images for emittance assessments at 33 MeV. Initial calculations reproduced a key feature of the phenomena.

The linac for this ADS will be a High Power Proton Accelerator delivering 2.4 MW CW beam at 600 MeV. It has to satisfy stringent requirements for reliability and availability: a beam-MTBF of 250h is targeted. The reliability goal is pursued through a phased approach. During Phase 1; expected till 2024; the MYRRHA linac up to 100 MeV will be constructed. It will allow to evaluate the reliability potential of the 600 MeV linac. It will also feed a Proton Target Facility in which radioisotopes of interest will be collected through an ISOL system. This contribution will focus on the transition to integrated prototyping; which will emphasize (i) a test platform consisting of the initial section of the normal conducting injector (5.9 MeV); (ii) the realization of a complete cryomodule for the superconducting linac and of its cryogenic valve box.

The accelerator provides clinical proton beams in the energy range 62-252 MeV and is designed to provide carbon ions in the range 120-400 MeV/n to three ion therapy irradiation rooms IRs; including a room with a proton Gantry. Proton beams of up to 800 MeV will be provided to a fourth room dedicated to research. Presently; proton beams are delivered to the fixed horizontal beam lines of three rooms. Beam commissioning of the vertical beam line of the second IR is being completed and the beam line is in preparation for clinical treatment. Commissioning of the accelerator with carbon ions is advancing and first clinical beams have been sent to the IRs; while the preparation for the Gantry beam line is ongoing. A slow extraction 3rd order resonance method is used to extract particles from the synchrotron between 0.1-10 seconds to favor control of the delivered dose during clinical treatments.

ipac2018,,TUPAF010,Empty Sweeping Bucket for Slow Extraction,L. Falbo; E. Bressi; C. Priano; CNAO Foundation; Milan; Italy; The extraction process from a synchrotron is one of the most important aspects of an accelerator devoted to clinical purposes; like the hadrontherapy in which hadron beams are used to treat tumors. Indeed the quality of the dose delivered to the patient; in terms of dose uniformity and precision in the beam characteristics; is defined by the way in which the beam is extracted. The quality of the extracted beam (the so called spill) is strongly affected by the stability of the power supplies of the synchrotron magnets whose field stability creates a ripple in the intensity of the extracted beam itself. When it is not possible to improve the power supply stability; it is needed to apply some additional techniques in order to cure the spill ripple. At CNAO; the italian hadrontherapy facility; it has been thought to improve the Empty Bucket Channelling technique by using an energy-moving bucket instead of a stationary bucket. The paper shows the implementation; the advantages and the efficacy of this RF gymnastic; named 'Empty Sweeping Bucket'.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF010,676

It is based on a synchrotron with a 77 m ring equipped with 16 normal conducting dipoles characterized by a long delay in the field stabilization. B-Train system is a fundamental device of the whole machine; it is used in feedback to the dipole power supply in order to regulate the magnetic field reducing the natural stabilization times that would cause long treatments. B-Train system allows to obtain the magnetic field starting from measurements of magnetic field changes: it works as an integrator and then it needs a system to reset the counts compensating the electronic and numerical drift of the system itself. An innovative method has been implemented at CNAO to reset Btrain counts exploiting beam measurements after the RF cavity trapping. This procedure has the advantage to avoid external and additional element like NMR probes. The paper shows the use of B-train system at CNAO and its calibration with this method; called ""RF-master method"".",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF011,679

Between both stages; a Medium Energy Beam Transport line (MEBT)** aims at transporting and matching the beam between the RFQ and the SRF linac. The transverse focusing of the beam is controlled by five quadrupole magnets with integrated steerers; grouped in one triplet and one doublet. Two buncher cavities handle the longitudinal dynamics. Two movable scraper systems are included to purify the beam optics coming out the RFQ and avoid losses in the SRF linac. In this contribution; checkout of the beamline and its ancillaries in Japan is reported.

The first section; consisting of 4 SCDTL modules (7 to 35 MeV); is operational at low repetition rate (up to 50 Hz). Whereas beam acceleration is effective even without closed loop control; to ensure high beam current stability the resonance frequency variation must be kept for each SDCTL module within few kHz. This is achieved implementing an automatic frequency control (AFC) loop that detects structure detuning caused by thermal drifts and produce an error signal fed to a tuning motor. A prototype of an AFC custom solution; derived from a medical electron linac; has been tested on TOP-IMPLART accelerator.

Since the 2016 run automated local aperture scans have been performed with the main focus on the vertical plane where limitations typically arise due to the flat vacuum chambers in most SPS elements. For LHC beams the aperture limitations with the present low integer tune optics also occur at locations with large dispersion. Aperture measurements in the horizontal plane using a variety of techniques were performed and showed surprising results; which could partially explain the unexpected losses of high intensity LHC beams at the SPS flat bottom. In this paper; reference measurements from 2016 are compared with the ones taken at the beginning of the run in 2017. Several aperture restrictions in the vertical plane could be found and cured; and a potential systematic restriction in the horizontal plane has been identified.

The facility serves more than 20 user teams for about 200 days of running each year and offers mixed secondary hadron; electron and muon beams of 0.5 GeV/c to 10 GeV/c. In addition; the primary proton beam or ion beam is transported to the irradiation facilities CHARM and IRRAD. Due to the steadily high user demand; the CERN management approved an upgrade and renovation of the facility to meet future beam test and physics requirements. New beam optics will assure a better transmission and purity of the secondary beams; now also with the possibility of highly pure electron; hadron or muon beams. The upgrade includes a pulsed powering scheme with energy recovering power supplies and new magnets; reducing both power and cooling requirements. Together with the building consolidation; this results in a considerably lower energy consumption. The renovation phase is scheduled during the technical stops between 2018 and 2020. We will give an overview of the project scope including upgrades and future beams.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf023_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf023.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf023_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF023,717

An upgrade is required to be able to withstand the beams that will be produced after the end of the LIU (LHC Injector Upgrade) project. For the design of the new dumps; the interaction and transport of beam and all secondary particles generated has been simulated using FLUKA. The working principle of the internal beam dump in the PS ring is very peculiar with respect to the other dumps in the CERN accelerator complex. A moving dump intercepts the circulating beam during few milliseconds like a fast scraper. The moving dump shaving the beam; the multi-turn transport of beam particles in the PS accelerator and a time-dependent energy deposition in the dump were modeled.

A dedicated coupled-bunch feedback for dipole oscillation modes; using a Finemet cavity as wide-band longitudinal kicker; suppresses the instabilities up to an intensity of about 2·1011 particles per bunch at extraction. However; dipole and quadrupole coupled-bunch oscillations are observed beyond this intensity. At the flat-top they were damped with a 40 MHz RF cavity operated as a higher-harmonic RF system to increase Landau damping; in addition to the principal RF system at 10 MHz. The existing 40 MHz RF system; designed for RF manipulations at fixed frequency; does not cover the frequency range required during acceleration. It is therefore proposed to install a tunable RF system with a 5% relative frequency swing. This paper summarizes the observations of instability damping at the flat-top and presents preliminary parameters for the higher-harmonic RF system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf026_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf026.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf026_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF026,728

An inclined septum magnet allows proper filling of the transverse phase-space plane, while longitudinal stacking requires momentum variation achieved by a shift of mean momentum over time provided by phase shifting a combination of 2 RF cavities at the exit of Linac3.

In most of the cases; the dumps were triggered by concurrently developing fast beam instabilities leading to particle losses in the betatron cleaning insertion. Many of the events started with a distinct sub-millisecond loss peak comparable to regular dust particle events; which have been observed along all the LHC since the start-up. In contrast to regular dust events; persistent losses developed in cell 16L2 after the initial peaks which can possibly be explained by a phase transition of macroparticles to the gas phase. In this paper; we summarize the observed loss characteristics such as spatial loss pattern and time profiles measured by Beam Loss Monitors (ionization chambers). Based on the measurements; we estimate the energy deposition in macroparticles and reconstruct proton loss rates as well as the gas densities after the phase transition.

The completion of the HIE-ISOLDE superconducting linac allows the acceleration of these ions to energy levels that were not reachable before; opening the door to new experiments in different fields. These experiments often have special requirements in terms of beam intensity and purity; transverse emittance or energy spread. A possible way to reduce the energy spread of the beam delivered to the experimental stations is to use one or more of the superconducting cavities as bunchers. The main results of several tests conducted during the last beam commissioning campaign prove that this mode of operation is feasible and will be presented in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF042,787
ipac2018,,TUPAF043,Testing the Double-Crystal Setup for Physics Beyond Colliders Experiments in the UA9-SPS Experiment,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; The UA9 experiment is installed in the CERN SPS to study how coherent interaction in crystalline materials can be used to steer particles beams. Recently; new experiments requiring complex beam manipulations by means of crystals have been proposed in the framework of the Physics Beyond Colliders study group at CERN. In particular; it was proposed to use a first crystal to direct protons from the LHC beam halo on a target placed in the beam pipe and to use a second crystal to deflect the particles produced in the target (double-crystal setup); allowing to measure their polarization. The layout of the UA9 experiment in the CERN SPS has been modified to study the feasibility of the proposed scenario and its compatibility with the delicate environment of a superconducting collider. A first set of measurements was performed in 2017 proving that the protons deflected by the first crystal can be intercepted and successfully deflected by a second crystal. A further upgrade of the experiment in 2018 will allow measuring more precisely the combined efficiency of the two crystals and the beam-induced background.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf043_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf043.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf043_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF043,790

Its performance is constantly being improved in frame of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) Project in order to prepare it for the future HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC) operation. One of the LIU goals is to nearly double the intensity extracted from the SPS; up to 2.32×1011 p/bunch. In recent years; nearly 10% of losses are observed for nominal intensity and LHC-type beams; they grow to about 20% for the intensity approaching the HL-LHC target. Beam losses imply activation and aging of the SPS hardware; the possibility to add a collimation system is being considered to mitigate this problem. In this paper we present studies of a collimation system design for the SPS. The concept is based on a primary horizontal collimator located in an available position with high enough dispersion; and a secondary collimator to intercept the particles leaking out from the primary collimator. Performance of the proposed collimation system is evaluated by means of numerical simulations.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf046.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF046,802

Beam intensity and transverse emittance are the key parameters to increase brightness; the latter being more difficult to manipulate. It is; therefore; crucial to monitor not only the emittance evolution between the different injectors but also along each acceleration cycle. To this end; detailed emittance measurements were carried out for the four rings of the PSB at various times in the cycle with different beam types. A thorough analysis of systematic error sources was conducted including multiple Coulomb scattering happening during profile measurements with wire scanners; where experimental and analytical treatments of the emittance blow-up were compared to FLUKA simulations. In order to properly account for the dispersive contribution; the full momentum spread profile was considered using a deconvolution method. We conclude with an assessment of this first comprehensive emittance evolution measurement along the PSB cycle.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf047_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf047.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf047_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF047,806

Though the signals of the beam loss monitors support this; many aspects remain unknown. Neither the source of the dust nor the release mechanism from the beam pipe are understood. The same holds for the forces involved in the interaction and the observed UFO rate reduction over the years. These open questions are approached from different angles. Firstly; a new data analysis tool was established featuring advanced raw data selection and statistical analysis. Results of this analysis will be presented. Secondly; dust samples were extracted from LHC components and analyzed to gain insight into the size distribution and material composition of the contamination. The performed observations and analysis lead to a better modelling of the UFO events and helped to understand the physics involved.

At CERN's Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) the ES is over 16 m long and composed of 5 separate units containing separate wire-arrays that can be moved independently. The tanks are all mounted on a single support structure that can move the ensemble coherently. As a result; the large number of positional degrees of freedom complicates the alignment procedure in operation. Obtaining and maintaining accurate alignment of the ES with the beam is therefore crucial for minimising beam loss. In this paper; we investigate the alignment procedure for different operational scenarios using particle tracking simulations to understand the beam loss along the extraction straight as a function of the relative positions of each of the 5 separate ES units. An important aspect of the study was to understand the required alignment tolerance to achieve optimum extraction efficiency for a given configuration of wire-array thicknesses.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF052,826

This is compounded by the lack of time structure in the extracted beam; as is typically required by the high-energy physics experiments; and the difficulty in accurately calibrating D.C. intensity monitors in the extraction line at count rates of ~ 1013 Hz. As a result; it is common for the extraction inefficiency to be measured by calibrating the beam loss signal induced by the slow extraction process itself.

In order to create this so-called dynamic bump; two orthogonal knobs were designed to enable independent movements of the beam in position and angle at the upstream end of the electrostatic extraction septum (ES). With the present slow extraction scheme; simulations show that the use of a dynamic bump can reduce the angular spread at the ES by roughly a factor two and reduce beam loss on the ES. A reduction in the angular spread is also a prerequisite to exploit the full potential of other loss reduction techniques being considered for implementation at the SPS; like the active or passive diffusers planned for installation upstream of the ES in 2018.

The ELENA cooler is a compact device incorporating an adiabatic expansion to reduce the electron beam temperature as well as electrostatic bending plates for efficient collection of the electron beam. The transverse components of the longitudinal field in the cooling section must be kept small (Bt/Bl ≤ 5x10-4) to ensure a minimal perturbation to the electron beam transverse temperature. The longitudinal field itself needs to be as low as possible such that the distortion to the closed orbit of the circulating ion beam due to the short 90° toroids is kept as small as possible.

This paper presents approximate closed-form expressions for the characteristics of the beam footprint and; based on the presented expressions; explores the parameter space of the raster magnets and beam parameters for achieving the optimal characteristics of the beam footprint.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF062,866

This implies the need of accurate models to correctly describe the longitudinal beam dynamics within the multi-cell cavities. In all the previous error studies the cells of a multi-cell cavity were modelled as a sequence of independent gaps and the errors were applied directly on the amplitude of each cell accelerating field; considered as random variable. In this paper; instead; we present a new detailed analysis of the effect of the error tolerances on the beam dynamics including a new model to calculate the amplitude errors of the accelerating field in the multi-cell cavities: errors are applied on the geometrical parameters of each cavity; then the accelerating field is calculated solving the Maxwell equations over all the cavity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupaf063_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupaf063.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupaf063_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAF063,870

The LEBT is used to focus and correct the proton beam trajectory and clean the head and tail of the proton pulse from the flat top before entering the RFQ.

The unmodulated Ladder-RFQ features a very constant voltage along the axis. It accepted 3 times the operating power of which is needed in operation**. That level corresponds to a Kilpatrick factor of 3.1 with a pulse length of 200 μs. The 325 MHz RFQ is designed to accelerate protons from 95 keV to 3.0 MeV according to the design parameters of the proton linac within the FAIR project. This particular high frequency creates difficulties for a 4-ROD type RFQ, which triggered the development of a Ladder RFQ with its high symmetry. The results of the unmodulated prototype have shown, that the Ladder-RFQ is a suitable candidate for that frequency. The duty cycle is suitable up to 5%. The basic design and tendering of the RFQ has been successfully completed in 2016. Manufacturing will be completed in May 2018.

The proton driver is a continuous-wave proton linac of 1.5 GeV and 10 mA; which means an extremely high beam power of 15 MW. After bombarding the target; the abandoned proton beam power is very high and should be separate from target station carefully. Because of the energy is not very high and the layout of following transport line isn't linear; we should design special separation line for high momentum proton beam.

In order to handle extremely-high stored energy in beam; the collimation system of extremely high efficiency is required for safe operation. SPPC has been studying a collimation method which arranges both the transverse and momentum collimations in one long straight section. In this way; the downstream momentum collimation section can clean those particles related to the single diffractive effect in the transverse collimation section thus eliminate beam losses in the arc section. In addition; one more collimation stage is obtained with use of special superconduct-ing quadrupoles in the transverse collimation section.

The horizontal space for MEBT elements is limited because two beam lines merge at 18-degree angle. The MEBT design developed with envelope codes includes two compact quarter-wave RF bunchers and four short quadrupoles with steerers; all within the length of about 1 m. The beam size in the MEBT is large; comparable to the beam-pipe aperture; hence non-linear 3D field effects at large radii become important. Using CST Studio codes; we calculate buncher RF fields and quadrupole magnetic fields and use them to perform particle-in-cell beam dynamics modeling of MEBT with realistic beam distributions from the RFQ. Our results indicate a significant emittance growth not predicted by standard beam dynamics codes. Its origin was traced mainly to the quadrupole edge fields. Quadrupole design modifications are proposed to improve the MEBT performance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupal035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupal035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupal035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAL035,

The accelerator is based on a 65-m ion synchrotron by Danfysik/Siemens Healthcare. Beam extraction from the synchrotron is driven by a transverse RF knock-out (KO) system featuring Dynamic Intensity Control (DIC) of the spill. DIC allows modulation of the extraction rate by factors up to 30 on millisecond time scales. A fast response of the system to the variable intensity set-point can be obtained by careful adjustment of the RF-KO spectrum relative to the machine tune. Tracking simulations of the extraction phase have been conducted to refine that behaviour.

As the injector of the driver linac; an RFQ is required to bunch and accelerate the 20 mA deuteron beam to 3 MeV with very high beam quality. In order to fulfil these requirements and re-duce time spent on optimization; an RFQ design pro-gram named RFQEP has been developed to generate the input file for the PARMTEQM code. In this program; the ‘matched and equipartitioned' design strategy is adopted to prevent halo formation and to avoid struc-ture resonances in high intensity RFQs. The detailed design aspects are studied in this paper and simulation results are given for an RFQ designed by this code; which shows the accuracy and the merits of the new program.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupal051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupal051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupal051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAL051,

Operation is based on a 50 Hz; 800 MeV proton synchrotron; accelerating up to 3·1013 protons per pulse (ppp); which provides beam to two target stations. ISIS is beam loss limited; so to achieve greater beam intensity and optimal operation; losses must be reduced. Some beam loss may be attributed to resonance lines found in betatron tune space. These could be driven by higher order magnet field components; errors or misalignment. This paper describes work measuring losses against tune space around the ISIS working point. Experiments have been carried out to measure beam loss against tune in the ISIS synchrotron. The experiments were done at low intensity to minimise space charge and intensity effects. Resonance lines that cause beam loss can be clearly identified and provide new information about the machine. The experimental process has been automated in order to decrease experiment duration and to reduce systematic human error. MAD-X models that compare the beam envelope at different points in tune space to the beam pipe aperture are used to distinguish between losses caused by increased envelope size and losses induced by driven resonances.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupal054_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupal054.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupal054_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAL054,

Protons are accelerated from 70 to 800 MeV in a 50 Hz rapid cycling synchrotron. Due to the intense beam; space charge forces are high during the first part of the acceleration cycle. The vacuum vessel in the synchrotron has a rectangular shape where the apertures are conformal to the design beam envelopes. At high intensities image forces interact with the beam; especially when the closed orbit is large. An analysis of image forces has been made and used to classify higher order image terms. These have been identified using simulations of round beams in rectangular vacuum vessels. The higher order image terms from harmonic closed orbits have been used with single particle resonance theory; taking account of the coherent nature of the beam response. Several predictions of beam resonance have been made. A simulation study has been carried out using a smooth focusing lattice and uniform density beams.

The development of these pure; exotic beams must be supported by continuing research and development on targets and ion sources. In the ARIEL era; new target/ion source geometries and operational modes will provide new opportunities which can only be exploited with time for development. To prioritize this; TRIUMF proposes to build a dedicated test stand for target and ion source research which will model the critical features of the new ARIEL target stations. This stand will provide a testing ground for methods of increasing efficiency and selectivity; such as investigations of new surface ion source [1; 2] and FEBIAD ion source [3] designs. In addition; this will provide a development environment for new beams; either from new target materials; or through techniques such as extracting molecular beams.

The upgrades in foil material and foil holders lead to significant improvements in beam quality and foil life time; as well as reduction of Be-7 contamination originated in the foils. Thus; an accumulated beam charge extracted with a single foil increased from ~60 mA·hours to more than 500 mA·hours. A key role that lead to these advances was an understanding of the foil heating mechanism; major contribution to which is paid by the power deposition from electrons stripped by the foil. To further diminish this effect; we recently introduced a foil tilt from the vertical orientation that allows stripped electrons fast escape from the foil; well before losing their original momentum through the heat deposition. Other improvements were related to operational issues. Introduction of a ""combo"" foil consisting of wide portion and thin wire allowed both high and low intensity beam extraction without foils sacrifice. Deploying a wedge foil for extraction at 100 MeV helped reduction of beam intensity instabilities caused by beam vertical size and position fluctuations.",Funding: Funded under a contribution agreement with NRC (National Research Council Canada).,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupal062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupal062.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupal062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPAL062,

Direct benefit from these studies is the possible identification of working points alternative to the nominal one (in terms of dynamic aperture).

To reach the high luminosity; short ion and electron bunches with high charge density colliding in high frequency are proposed in JLEIC design. The high charge density of the ion beam leads to strong intrabeam scattering effect; which enlarges the ion beam emittance and ruins the luminosity if not mitigated. Magnetized electron cooling is implemented to overcome the intrabeam scattering effect and to reduce or maintain the ion beam emittance. In this paper; we discuss the redistribution of the cooling effects in the longitudinal and the transverse directions by introducing the dispersion of the ion beam in the cooling section. When the charge density of the cooling electron beam varies; the dispersion of the ion beam leads to an increase of the transverse cooling rate and a reduction of the longitudinal cooling rate; while the total decrement of the Courant-Snyder invariant of the ion beam increases.

Beam stability is critical where the requirements are driven from the beam size which is expected to approach 4 microns vertically at the insertion device (ID) source points. AC rms beam stability requirements are defined as 10 % the minimum source size at the ID in the band 0.01-1000 Hz. The vertical plane stability goal is the most ambitious requiring a stability of 400 nm at the ID source point. In addition; long term drift defined as motion over a seven day timescale can be no more than 1 micron. In order to achieve these demanding beam stability requirements; a suite of beam diagnostics will be required including rf BPMs; X-ray BPMs; a mechanical motion measurement system; beam size monitors and a real time orbit feedback system.

Electron clouds; generated by electron multipacting in the beam pipes; leads to beam instabilities and beam-induced heat load in cryogenic systems. Laser Engineered Surface Structures (LESS) is a novel surface treatment which changes the morphology of the internal surfaces of vacuum chambers. The surface modification results in a reduced secondary electron yield (SEY) and; consequently; in the eradication of the electron multipacting. Low SEY values of the treated surfaces and flexibility in choosing the laser parameters make LESS a promising treatment for future accelerators. LESS can be applied both in new and existing accelerators owing to the possibility of automated in-situ treatment. This approach has been developed and optimised for the LHC beam screens in which the electron cloud has to be mitigated before the HL-LHC upgrade.

Beam is extracted with a momentum selection scheme in which beam enters the third order resonance driven by a betatron core. When irradiating a tumor; it is thought as divided in the longitudinal plane in several slices while each slice is divided in the transverse plane in several spots called voxels. Considering the dose uniformity that can be obtained during extraction; the machine must extract an average intensity related to the voxel that requires less dose. Therefore during a treatment; for some slices; a technique is needed to lower the extracted beam intensity with respect to the nominal one. A way to guarantee the correct average intensity according to the treatment planning requirements; is to introduce a mechanical filter (a degrader) that reduces the intensity of the accelerated particles. However this method used in the first treatments at CNAO showed some disadvantages and it has been replaced by what has been called the ""dynamic betatron"" method. The paper shows the implementations and the advantages of this method in the CNAO treatments.",,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tuzgbf3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tuzgbf3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tuzgbf3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUZGBF3,

To allow users to take advantage of this small beam size; the beam orbit motion has to be kept stable to within a fraction of the beam size. To keep the beam orbit stable on a sub-micron level; one needs to carefully design magnet supports/girders so that the ground motion does not lead to excessive orbit motion due to resonant modes of magnet supports. In this paper; we will describe the process of calculating the expected orbit motion due to girder resonant vibration.

To allow users to take advantage of this small beam size; the beam orbit motion has to be kept stable to within a fraction of the beam size; which translates to sub-micron orbit stability requirement.

At the same time; the lattice amplification factors reduce when the ground motion becomes coherent at low frequencies. In this paper; we will present simulation of the lattice amplification factor dependence on the ground motion coherence length and show results of the ground motion coherence measurements at APS.

Several different methods have been explored for nonlinear dynamics optimization. The optimization objectives variously include the chromaticities up to third order; resonance driving and detuning terms; on- and off-momentum dynamic acceptance; chromatic and geometric tune footprint; local momentum acceptance (LMA); variation of betatron oscillation invariant; Touschek lifetime; etc. In addition; optimization can be performed without errors; with selected random errors; and with sets of errors that reflect post-commissioning conditions. In this paper; these different optimization methods are compared for the nonlinear beam dynamics performance of the Advanced Photon Source upgrade (APS-U) lattice; in terms of the dynamic acceptance; local momentum acceptance; and other performance measures.

The idea of using pulsed multipole injection on off-energy closed-orbit was first proposed in 2014 and then developed for Swiss Light Source (SLS) upgrade in 2015. In 2017; the anti-septum was proposed for SLS upgrade injection. In this paper; two similar injection schemes are proposed which combine off-axis accumulation on off-energy closed-orbit (no betatron oscillations); with the anti-septum or pulsed nonlinear kicker schemes. Preliminary lattice solutions are developed for Advanced Photon Source upgrade (APS-U) where a special injection straight (with length of 5.8 m) is designed with horizontal dispersion of 0.15m. The impact on the ring emittance is relatively small. The injection elements are all placed in this injection straight; including 1 thin septum and 3 slow kickers (or 1 pulsed nonlinear kicker).

Semiconductor photocathodes; especially when used in high rep-rate photo-injectors; are known to show QE degradation over time and must be replaced. The total QE is the basic diagnostic which is used widely and is easy to obtain. However; a QE map indicating variations of QE across the cathode surface has greater utility. It can quickly diagnose problems of QE inhomogeneity. Most QE mapping techniques require hours to complete and are thus disruptive to a user facility schedule. A fast; single-shot method has been proposed (citation) using a micro-lens array (MLA) generated QE map. In this paper we report the implementation of the method at Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility. A micro-lens array (MLA) is used to project an array of beamlets onto the photocathode.

The cavity will serve as a major component in diagnostic line. In LEReC project the requirement on the energy spread of the electron beam is extremely high (better than 10-4) and the diagnostic system has to to be designed accordingly. The 704 MHz transverse deflecting cavity provides the vertical kick to the beam after it passes through the dispersion dipole so that we can measure the energy spread of the core of the bunch. Traditional way of determining the electrical center of the cavity involves the needle pulling and integration of the signal which is prone to the cumulative error. We present the measurement result from a wire stretching system that is much more efficient and accurate compared to the bead/needle pulling method.

In the circumstances of implementing local bumps; changing ID gaps; and long-term drifting; the fast orbit feedback (FOFB) requires shifting the fast corrector strengths to the slow correctors to prevent the fast corrector saturation and to make the beam orbit stable in the sub-micron level. As the result; a reliable and precise technique of fast-to-slow corrector strength shift has been developed and tested at NSLS-II. This technique is based on the fast corrector response to the slow corrector change when the FOFB is on. In this article; the shift technique is described and the result of proof-of-principle experiment carried out at NSLS-II is presented. The maximum fast corrector current was reduced from greater than 0.45 A to less than 0.04 A with the orbit perturbation within ±1 μm.

The injector consists of a 200 MeV linac injecting a 3 GeV booster. Recent operational events have caused us to investigate 100 MeV injection into the booster. As the booster was not designed for injection at this low energy; beam loss is observed with this low energy booster injection. This beam loss not only results of overall charge loss from the train; but a change in the overall charge distribution in the bunch train. In this paper we discuss the performance of injecting into the storage ring with the inefficient charge transfer through the injector.

The linac contains five traveling-wave S-band accelerating structures driven by two high-power klystrons; with a third klystron as spare. In the event that the spare klystron is not available; the failure of one klystron will prohibit the linac from injecting into the booster as the energy is too low. Therefore; we wish to develop a new operational mode that the NSLS-II injector can operate with a single klystron providing 100 MeV beam from the linac. A decremented approach with intermediate energies 170 MeV; 150 MeV; etc.; takes advantages of pre-calculated booster ramps and beam based online optimization. By lowering the booster injection energy in a small step and online optimizing at each step; we were able to achieve 100 MeV booster injection. 170 MeV operation mode of the NSLS-II injector has been implemented since May 31; 2017; with a similar overall performance compared to the standard 200 MeV operation but fewer klystron trips. 100 MeV single-klystron operation has been successfully demonstrated with 20-30% overall efficiency; which is limited by booster acceptance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf037_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf037.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf037_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF037,
ipac2018,,TUPMF038,Design Considerations for an Ultralow Emittance Storage Ring for the Canadian Light Source,CLS; Saskatoon; Saskatchewan; Canada,,Demands from light source scientists for more brilliant xray beams have resulted in the emergence of 4th generation storage rings. These demands include photon beams that are highly focussed and beams with high transverse coherence. Both these requirements are achieved with ultralow electron beam emittance. The practical development of the multi-bend achromat (MBA) concept by MAX IV has spurred many synchrotron light sources around the world to develop similar machines. For existing facilities two options are available: upgrading existing machines or building a new structure. The Canadian Light Source (CLS) has explored both options and has determined a new storage ring is required. Several design options for a 3.0 GeV ring have been developed. Best results are achieved when tracking is used to optimize the phase advance through the MBA structure to reduce the impact of the sextupoles on the dynamic aperture. Structures where no geometric sextupoles are required have been achieved while producing ultralow emittances. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf038_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf038.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf038_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF038,

However; the operating point was not the design operating point and the booster suffered from poor quantum lifetime at the extraction energy. The low quantum lifetime caused current loss of approximately 25% in the microseconds before extraction. We have recommissioned the booster using the design optics; and the current loss before extraction is now only 6%.

ipac2018,,TUPMF040,Alignment of Current Strips at the Canadian Light Source,CLS; Saskatoon; Saskatchewan; Canada; SINAP; Shanghai; People's Republic of China; The Quantum Materials Spectroscopy Centre beamline at the Canadian Light Source will employ a 180 mm period elliptically polarizing undulator (EPU180); which will have significant impacts on beam dynamics with large tune shifts and reductions in dynamic aperture. Current strips mounted to the vacuum chamber are intended to mitigate the effects of EPU180 with each strip powered by an independent power supply. It is important to accurately model the current strips in order to calculate the required compensation. We model the current strips as straight wires; parallel to the electron beam; with small horizontal and vertical displacements from their nominal positions. As the real current strips are not completely straight; this is an effective model; but justified as we are mostly interested in the magnetic field integrated along the strips. By activating two strips and measuring the ratio of the two currents needed to minimize closed orbit distortion in the horizontal and vertical planes; we can find the effective horizontal and vertical displacements of the straight wires in the model. Our goal is to create an effective model of the strips from beam-based measurements.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF040,

In many applications; higher spatial resolution is needed to discover smaller defects. Decreasing the spot size of the X-Ray source is a promising way to get higher spatial resolution. Rhodotron have been used to produce high power CW electron beam in hundreds of kilowatts level. In this paper; we propose to use an improved Rhodotron to generate high brightness electron beam with high average power. Beam dynamics study shows that when producing tens of kilowatts electron beam; the normalized RMS emittance can be lower than 10 μm; and the relative RMS energy spread can be lower than 0.2%. The beam can be focused to a spot size of about 100μm by using a series of quadruple; and converted to X-Ray by using a rotating target within several kilowatts beam power.

Thus it is interesting to explore a way of obtaining sub-picosecond radiation pulses in storage ring light sources.

ipac2018,,TUPMF071,Status of Impedance Modeling for the PETRA IV,Y.-C. Chae; R. Wanzenberg; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; The diffraction limited synchrotron light source envisioned for the PETRA IV project will require strong focusing to produce the small emittances in both planes. The large natural chromaticity together with small dispersion will require very strong sextupoles. In order to cope with high gradient magnets the radius of vacuum chamber tends to be in the range of 10 mm; which is very small compared to the current 40-mm wide elliptic chamber. The impedance element in the PETRA III was scaled down to fit into the smaller aperture so that the short range wakepotential can be computed numerically. For instance the beam position monitor (BPM) was reduced to 60% in dimension so that it can be used in PETRA IV. Even if the actual design of hardware does not exist yet; we assume that generic feature of PETRA III model is still valid. In this paper we report the up-to-date information on impedance model of PETRA IV together with the preliminary impedance budget based on the analytical formula. We also report the specific studies carried out to understand the kickfactor scaling with the chamber aperture whose radius is in the range of 8-12 mm.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF071,

Naive application of Keil-Schnell criteria predicts the threshold of microwave instability at 0.25 mA. Since the single bunch intensity is in the range of 0.2-2.5 mA depending on the fill-pattern of PETRA III; we expect to observe the fill-pattern dependent energy spread according to the theory. However; the 3rd generation light sources comparable to PETRA III often reported the observation which was much greater than the theoretical one. In order to induce the beam size variation we had used skew quadrupoles to generate the dispersion in vertical plane. In particular we made dispersion bump at the undulator sector so that we were able to use the X-ray optics for the precise determination of small vertical beam size. In this paper we report the experimental setup and measurement data with the estimate on the instability threshold. We also report the vertical emittance and energy spread based on the X-ray beam size measurement as well as the RF signal which was excited by the beam at the longitudinal feedback cavity.; * K.

ipac2018,,TUPMF073,Impedance Optimization of Small Gap Chambers for the High Single Bunch Current Operation at the Undulator Based Light Sources,DESY; Hamburg; Germany; In the undulator based light sources the intensity limit of single bunch is often determined by the strong vertical instability caused by the wakefield in the ring; where the undulator itself is large impedance source. The optimization of transition from the large aperture to undulator's small-gap chamber is on-going research topic in an effort to reduce the vertical impedance; at the same time; the demand on single-bunch current is high from the timing-mode x-ray user community. In this paper; after showing the results obtained by exploring the parameter space guided by Stupakov's formula; we propose the linearly-segmented transition which can reduce the impedance down to 60% or less of the original linear taper. The reduction can be utilized either to increase the bunch current substantially or to install a smaller gap chamber without impacting the bunch current limit. For the definite result we considered the transition between two ellipses; namely; (a; b) = (42 mm; 21 mm) and (18 mm; 4 mm) over the length 15-30 cm in beam direction.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf073_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf073.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf073_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF073,

Out of many possibilities we firstly computed the intrabeam-scattering (IBS) effects on the emittance as well as lifetime as a function of current. The result indicated that PETRA IV would benefit from the reduced peak current when the harmonic cavity lengthens the bunch. The operating point of harmonic cavity was explored by tracking simulations as well as analytic formula. In order to compute the energy spread and bunch length we had used the known impedance function of the APS**. In this way more realistic estimation of IBS effects was expected. However; because of the complex nature of PETRA IV lattice; which includes achromatic cells for undulators; arc cells of octants and straight sectors for damping wigglers; we simplify the longitudinal dynamics by assuming the ring made of 92 multi-bend-achromat (MBA) cells. The optics is approximated as a linear-chromatic transfer map enabling fast tracking and the ring impedance is concatenated into the one location.

The natural emittance of PETRA III is extremely low with 1.3 nm*rad and the coupling is typically less than 1%. PETRA III is operated with a beam current of 100 mA using two different filling modes: a continuous mode with 960 bunches and a timing mode with 40 bunches. It has been observed that the horizontal emittance depends on the filling pattern and is in timing mode slightly larger compared to the emittance in the continuous mode. Despite the high energy of 6 GeV intrabeam scattering contributes for a slight emittance growth due to the small natural emittance and coupling of the machine. The increase of the emittance as a function of the single bunch current has been measured by using different filling patterns at a fixed beam current of 100 mA. The measurements of the emittance and the lifetime as a function of the single bunch current will be compared with theoretical expectations of the emittance growth due to intrabeam scattering and the Touschek lifetime.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmf083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmf083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmf083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMF083,

Ideally the orbit bump generated by the 10 μs long half-sine pulses of the kickers should be closed. Due to differences in pulse shape as well as timing and amplitude errors of the pulses there is some leakage of the injection bump which disturbs the closed orbit and affects the beam quality during top-up operation.

After two distortion incidents that required the replacement of the fingers; their removal was decided. The decision could be supported by the observation that most of the additional impedance is created above the cut-off frequency of the beam pipe. This was later confirmed by a temperature decrease in that zone after the removal. Furthermore it was checked that the thresholds of the longitudinal coupled bunch instabilities of modes trapped around the resulting open gap are above the maximal applied beam current of 400 mA.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupmk001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupmk001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupmk001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPMK001,

The ultra-low emittance (about 30 pm in both planes) combined with the desire to provide high charge (15 nC) in individual bunches; entails very high energy density in the beam. Simple estimates; confirmed by simulation; indicate that interaction of such a bunch with the dump material will result in localized melting. Over time; it is possible that the beam would drill through the dump and vent the ring vacuum. This would seem to prevent extraction and dumping of bunches as part of swap out; and also suggests that transferring of bunches out of the ring carries significant risk. We devised an idea for using a pre-kicker to cause decoherence of the target bunch emittances; making it safe to extract. Simulations show that the concept works very well.; *L.

Emittance Exchange (EEX) beamline makes transverse-to-longitudinal exchange of phase space. In this beamline; a transverse focusing at the upstream introduces a longitudinal compression at the downstream due to the exchange. Since this exchange scheme does not rely on the velocity or the path length differences; it does not require any longitudinal manipulation (e.g. chirp); and it could generate a short bunch with well-controlled nonlinear effects using nonlinear magnets.

The ICS interaction is critically dependent on the quality of driver pulses such as: 1) available peak intensity; 2) energy/pointing stability; and 3) relative timing stability to UV pulses initially triggering electron beams. Here; we report on a highly stable; 1 kHz; 200 mJ; 1.1 ps; 1030 nm laser with good beam quality as an ICS driver; optically synchronized to a UV photocathode laser. The ICS driver is based on a Yb:YAG thin-disk regenerative amplifier (RGA); ensuring an excellent energy stability (shot-to-shot 0.52% rms; 0.14% rms over 24 hours). The pointing stability better than 4 urad is obtained. The M2 factor is as good as ~1.5 at the full energy; leading to the achievable laser intensity of >1017 W/cm2 with f/10 focusing. The photocathode laser; a frequency-quadrupled Yb:KGW RGA; share a common seed oscillator with the ICS driver for optical synchronization. The residual sub-ps timing drift is further reduced to 33 fs rms using an optical locking scheme based on a parametric amplifier.; * W.S.

Beginning from the 70 MeV drive beam line; the high frequency (C-band and above) rf power is extracted from the beam by a decelerating structure (a.k.a. power extractor); transferred to an accelerating structure in the witness beam line; and used to accelerate the 15 MeV main beam. These high frequency accelerating structures usually have a small aperture to obtain high gradient and high efficiency; making it difficult for the low energy main beam to pass. To address this issue; one proposal is to increase the main beam energy to above 30 MeV by replacing the current witness linac. A 9-cell 𝜋-mode L-band standing-wave accelerating structure has therefore been designed to meet the high shunt impedance and low cost requirements.

The ATF's terawatt CO2 laser is a unique scientific instrument allowing researchers to explorer new particle acceleration mechanisms and to study light/matter interaction at an order-of-magnitude longer photon wavelengths compared to the majority of other laser research facilities (λ≈10μm). Continuous development over more than two decades brought the ATF's CO2 laser to the limit of peak power achievable in a conventional gas laser MOPA configuration (in ATF's amplifier geometry this is ~0.5 TW in routine operation; and up to 2 TW in some experiments). To overcome this limit; we employ; for the first time in a gas laser; a chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) scheme. The goal of our current research and development effort is to demonstrate 3-5 TW peak power at the system output and to reliably deliver a large fraction of this power as a high-quality beam to a range of user experiments.

The BNL magnetron source presently delivers 110 -120 mA H− ion current with 650 us pulse duration and 7 Hz repetition rate. The pulse duration was increased to 1000 μs by modifications of the gas injector pulsed valve and the use of the new arc-discharge power supply (with the arc-current stabilization circuit) which improved current stability and reduced current noise. The Low Energy Beam Transport (LEBT) lines combine two beams. The first line is the polarized OPPIS (Optically Pumped Polarized H− Ion Source) beam-line and the second is the high-intensity un-polarized beam-line from the magnetron source; which transports beam to the RFQ after the passage of 45 degree bending magnet. The second magnetron source was installed in the straight LEBT section in 2017; in which the polarized OPPIS beam was not planned. In this; optimal for H− beam transport configuration; the beam intensity was increased to 80 mA after the RFQ.

These accelerated beams are assessed for their capability to drive a free-electron laser. The ultra short; low emittance; and low energy spread properties of bunches produced from certain PWFA injection schemes naturally lend themselves to this task. However; these bunch lengths; typically in the few femtosecond range; are difficult to temporally resolve with traditional diagnostic methods. In order to longitudinally diagnose these bunches it is necessary to utilise the properties of a transverse RF deflecting cavity operating in a high-frequency regime. It is proposed that this type of X-band transverse deflection system; styled the PolariX-TDS due to its novel variable polarisation feature; will be introduced to the FLASHForward beam line in order to perform these single-shot longitudinal phase space measurements. This paper will concern itself with the efficacy of longitudinally reconstructing PWFA-bunches expected at FLASHForward with this TDS; with a focus on the variable bunch properties expected from early commissioning of the experiment.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupml017_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupml017.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupml017_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPML017,

It has been demonstrated in simulations that the electrons can be accelerated to energy frontier with well-preserved beam quality in a long hollow plasma channel.

Otherwise asymmetric transverse wakefields along the axis are induced; which could distort the driving bunch and deteriorate the witness beam quality.

It is seeded by initial transverse asymmetries of the beam or plasma phase space distributions. The beam centroid displacement is thereby amplified during the propagation in the plasma; which can lead to an unstable acceleration process. A witness beam can itself cause hosing and/or may be affected by the hosing of the drive beam. The accurate study of hosing including a witness beam is of utmost importance to facilitate stable plasma-based accelerators. In this contribution; we discuss novel methods for the mitigation of hosing and present a new model for the evolution of the plasma centroid; which enables the accurate investigation of the hose instability of drive and witness beam pair in the nonlinear blowout regime.

The proton beam is much longer than the plasma wavelength; and must be formed into small; sub- wavelength sized beamlets before it can effectively drive the wake. These beamlets are referred to as micro-bunches and are formed by the plasma self-modulation instability. An im- portant aspect of AWAKE is to measure the depth; frequency; and stability of the modulation; as this provides critical in- formation for establishing the presence of a high-amplitude wakefield driven by a self-modulation proton bunch.

The experiment is built up of an energy storage with up to 1; 35kJ with a 2% Hydrogen in Helium gas mixture as working gas. The small fraction of Hydrogen is necessary to use the linear Stark-broadening of the H-line to determine the electron density; which is in the range up to 1015cm-3. By the collision of two plasma sheaths in an angle of 180°; the electron density has been increased by a factor of 2.5 compared to the single plasma sheath. As an alternative; the compression of the plasma by funnel geometries has been studied. As has been found; the achieved electron densities are more than a magnitude higher; compared to the values of the plasma collision. Thus; the H-line is broadened too high to be used. Alternatively; the broadening of a copper line by the quadratic Stark-effect has been calibrated and used to determine those high electron densities of about 1018cm-3.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/tupml051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/tupml051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/tupml051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-TUPML051,

However; damage in a cell nucleus caused by the LMI system does not necessarily simulate a radiation effect. If the laser of the LMI system is replaced with a small-scale 1MeV-class accelerator such as a dielectric laser accelerator (DLA); experiments might be performed under conditions that are more realistic. The desirable configuration of the DLA for a compact micro-beam irradiation system is that laser pulses are transported to a dielectric structure by single-mode optical fibers and the laser energy is accumulated in an accelerator channel. The long and low-intensity laser pulse of 100 MW/cm2; 10ps and a resonator with Q=104 are capable of producing the light intensity of 1 TW/cm2. The long laser pulse; i.e.; low laser induced damage threshold intensity; decreases the acceleration gradient to about 1/3 of the ultra-short pulse irradiation of 100 fs. The length of the accelerator at long-laser pulse might be within the allowable range of several cm.

It is a serious issue to ensure sufficient integrated proton number on target (POT) for each facility. A stretcher ring (ST) can solve this serious problem. A beam accelerated by the MR is transferred to the ST and is slowly extracted over several second. While the beam is slowly extracted in the ST; the MR can accelerate and deliver a beam to the NU. The ST is put above the MR and fitted in the MR tunnel. Arc sections in the ST consist of superconducting combined function magnets (dipole; quadrupole and sextupole components); and separated function quadruple and sextupole magnets (hybrid lattice). A 30 GeV beam transfer line (BT) from the MR to the ST uses superconducting combined magnets with dipole and quadrupole functions to shorten the BT. The transferred beam is injected into an arc section in the ST. The adoption of the superconducting magnets in the ST and the BT saves operation cost drastically.

This is a one of key R&D items for a new planned muon g-2/EDM experiment at J-PARC; which aims to measure g-2 to a factor 5 better statistical precision and a factor of 100 better sensitivity for the electric dipole moment measurement (EDM) compared to the previous experiments. The new scheme provides a smooth injection utilizing a radial solenoidal fringe field; without causing any error field in the storage volume. Magnetic pulsed kicker will guide and set the beam in the storage field volume. The strongest point of this new scheme is that any source of the electric field is removed in this scheme to perform ideal EDM measurement. We have performed a test bench experimental work to demonstrate a feasibility of this new injection scheme. Instead of the muon beam; we inject electron beam; from an electron-gun; into the solenoid magnet; and detect three-dimensional spiral beam trajectory inside of the storage chamber by CCD camera.

A wedge absorber within the MICE cooling channel could serve as a demonstration of the type of emittance exchange needed for 6-D cooling; including the configurations needed for muon colliders. Parameters for this test have been explored in simulation and applied to experimental configurations using a wedge absorber in the MICE beam. A wedge absorber has been constructed and placed in MICE and data has been collected for both direct emittance exchange; where the longitudinal emittance decreases; and reverse emittance exchange; where the transverse emittance decreases.

The muon beam parameters are measured before and after the cooling cell using high precision scintillating-fibre trackers in a solenoidal magnetic field. Position and momentum reconstruction of each muon in MICE allows the development of several alternative figures of merit in addition to emittance. Contraction of the phase-space volume of the sample; or equivalently the increase in phases-pace density at its core; is an unequivocal cooling signature. Single-particle amplitude; defined as a weighted distance to the sample centroid; can be used to probe the change in density in the core of the beam. Alternatively; non-parametric statistics provide reliable methods to estimate the entire phase-space density distribution and reconstruct probability contours. The aforementioned techniques; robust to transmission losses and sample non linearities; are ideal candidates for a cooling measurement in MICE.

The ESS linac is expected to be operational by 2023 delivering 5 MW average power; 2 GeV proton beam; with 2.86 ms long pulses at a rate of 14 Hz. The primary proton beam-line completing the linac will consist of an accumulator ring to compress the beam pulses to 1.3 μs and a switchyard to distribute the protons onto the target station. The secondary beam-line producing neutrinos will consist of a four-horn/target station; a decay tunnel and a beam dump. A megaton scale water Cherenkov detector will be located at a baseline of about 500 km in one of the existing mines in Sweden and it will measure the neutrino oscillations.

At SACLA; the parallel operation of three beamlines; BL1~3; has been open to user experiments since September 2017. BL1 is a soft x-ray beamline driven by a dedicated accelerator; which is a former SCSS linac; and BL2 and 3 are XFEL beamlines; which share the electron beam from the SACLA main linac. In the parallel operation; a kicker magnet with 10 ppm stability (peak-to-peak) switches the two XFEL beamlines at 60 Hz from pulse to pulse. To ensure wide spectral tunability and optimize the laser performance; the energies and lengths of the electron bunches are independently adjusted for the two beamlines according to user experiments. Since the electron bunch of SACLA has typically 10~15 fs (FWHM) in length and its peak current exceeds 10 kA; the CSR effect at a dogleg beam transport to BL2 is quite significant. In order to suppress the CSR effects; an isochronous and achromatic lattice based on two DBA structures was introduced.

The first such device is currently being built for the APS storage ring. It is based on a superconducting magnet with a conventional double-helical coil structure. This helical superconducting undulator will be completed in 2017. In addition; the concept of a novel SuperConducting Arbitrarily Polarizing Emitter (SCAPE) has been suggested and is now under development.

Such a device is capable of generating either planar or circular polarized photons; depending on which pair of magnets is energized. The SCAPE undulators could be attractive for the APS Upgrade and other fourth-generation storage rings with a multi-bend achromat lattice; as well as for FELs where utilization of round beam vacuum chambers becomes possible.

Three gap movable SASE Undulator Systems are designed to produce FELs with tunable wavelengths from 0.05 to 5.2nm [*; **]. A total of 91 5-m long undulator segments based on hybrid NdFeB permanent magnet technology were tuned respecting tight specifications. Radiation damage due to machine operation affects the magnetic properties of the segments and the quality of the SASE process. An array of dosimeters based on Radfets [***] and Gafchromic films monitors the absorbed doses in every undulator segment and each SASE system is equipped with a 12mm gap diagnostic undulator (DU) which is magnetically re-measured during machine maintenance weeks. Doses up to 4 kGy have been observed and magnetic field degradation higher than 3% is measured. These results permit to estimate the effects of radiation damage and life expectancy of the Undulator Systems based on the precise K-parameter determination for beam operation.

The proposed; Partially Stripped Ion beam driven; light source is the backbone of the Gamma Factory (GF) initiative. It could be realized at CERN by using the infrastructure of the already existing accelerators. It could push the intensity limits of the presently operating light-sources by up to 7 orders of magnitude; reaching fluxes of 1017 photons/s in the interesting gamma-ray energy domain between 1 MeV and 400 MeV. The GF light-source cannot be replaced; in this energy domain; by a FEL source as long as the multi TeV electron beams are not available. Its intensity is beyond the reach of the Inverse Compton Scattering sources. The unprecedented-intensity; energy-tuned gamma beams; together with the gamma-beams-driven secondary beams of polarized leptons; neutrinos; neutrons and radioactive ions are the basic research tools of the proposed Gamma Factory.

Such compactness may be obtained by an all-optical approach; which employs a laser-driven high gradient accelerator based on inverse free electron laser (IFEL); followed by an inverse Compton scattering (ICS) IP; a scheme where a laser is used as an undulator. We discuss experimental progress in understanding high-intensity effects in ICS; as well as the development of an efficient IFEL. We then describe the proof-of-principle of an all-optical IFEL-based system; where a TW-class CO2 laser pulse is split in two; with half used to accelerate a high quality electron beam up to 84 MeV through the IFEL interaction; and the other half acts as an electromagnetic undulator to generate up to 13 keV X-rays via ICS.

Careful consideration of the longitudinal matching is required not only in order to ensure a high peak current; low energy spread bunch is delivered to the FEL but also to support the deceleration and energy recovery of the spent beam. In a similar manner; longitudinal phase space manipulation can be utilised for pulse shaping in bunch compression; to minimise the influence of CSR-induced emittance growth. In this paper; we present a method for longitudinal phase space matching based upon the avoidance of electron trajectory caustics. Through considering the conditions under which caustics will form; we generate exclusion plots identifying the viable parameter space at numerous positions through beam acceleration and energy recovery. The result is a method for selecting the linear momentum compaction and the higher-order momentum compaction to satisfy the non-caustic condition whilst achieving the bunch compression or lengthening as required.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/weygbe2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/weygbe2.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/weygbe2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEYGBE2,

Current projects take these effects into account using well known synchrotron radiation (SR) formulas. In this talk I show that these formulas are not applicable for colliders with crab-waist collisions (all new projects of circular e+e− colliders) because at these colliders the deflection angle during the beam collisions θ< 1/γ. In this case the characteristic maximum frequency is ωm ≈cγ2/σ instead of the SR critical frequency ωc≈cγ3/ρ (where σ is the crossing length); the ratio ωm/ωc >1 and the spectrum is completely different. As result all effects due to beamstrahlung are stronger than give standard SR formulas.

This increase requires a reduction of the machine's impedance to ensure the coherent stability of the beams until they are put in collision. A major part of the impedance is the resistive wall contribution of the collimators. To reduce this contribution several coating options have been proposed. We have studied numerically the effect of the novel coatings on the beam stability. The results show that a decrease of up to 30% of the machine impedance and a reduction of up to 120 A in the stabilizing octupole current threshold can be achieved by coating the secondary collimators with Molybdenum. Half of that improvement can be obtained by coating the jaws of a subset of four collimators identified as the highest contributors to machine impedance.

However; it was recently proposed* that another mechanism is currently enabling both the existing SRF cavities with the quench field in excess of niobium Hc1; and providing the path forward to higher gradients; namely the vortex nucleation time slower than the rf period. If true; differently from currently pursued higher DC Hsh materials (e.g. Nb3Sn; MgB2 etc) or multi-layered structures; the new proposed directions are doping of the top niobium surface with special types of inelastic electron-phonon scattering ""slowing down"" impurities; or coating with thin layers of LOW (and not high) Tc superconductors.

ipac2018,,WEPAF003,Beamline Architect,J.D. Kunz; C.M. Conrad; L.M. Romero; Anderson University; Anderson; USA; Beamline Architect is a new particle accelerator simulation tool. Currently; two of the most widely used tools in this field are G4beamline and COSY Infinity. While these codes are fast and quite accurate; sometimes their interfaces can be time-consuming for students to learn; particularly undergraduate students or students whose primary field is not accelerator physics. Without Beamline Architect; each code has its own high-level language that must be manually written into a file and then executed on the command line. Moreover; sometimes the use of both simulation tools is warranted in order to check for consistency between the codes. Writing the codes by hand or translating between software can sometimes be cumbersome; even for experts. Furthermore; knowledge of an additional language; such as Python; is required in order to analyze the outputs of the codes (which may be in different formats from one another). Beamline Architect is a tool that provides a graphical user interface to G4beamline and COSY Infinity. This lets the user build a particle accelerator channel in 3D with or without using code. The channel may then be saved; exported; translated; or run. Any output data will be plotted in Beamline Architect using Python; since it is both flexible aesthetically and quite standard in the particle accelerator community. For undergraduate and non-accelerator students; Beamline Architect allows a hands-on experience with accelerator simulations. Some applications for these students include health physics radiation dosimetry problems; medical imaging mechanics; security scanner simulations; and (of course) accelerator channel design for particle physics experiments. For experts; Beamline Architect provides visual confirmation of the channel and a faster; more consistent way of cross-referencing results between the codes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf003.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF003,

Light is generated from lost electrons passing through high-purity; fused-silica fiber optic cable. The cable acts as both radiator and light pipe to a Pb-shielded photomultiplier tube. Results from a prototype installation along the PAR south wall have shown excellent sensitivity; linearity; and reproducibility after 10; 000 hours of operation to date with little change in the optical transmission of the fiber. High sensitivity allows more accurate measurement of low-level loss than possible with current monitors. The radiator and detector provide a much faster response than the installed gamma or neutron detectors. A faster; more accurate response to electron loss will be important as we run with higher charge and consider operating at increased energy for APS-U.

The Bunch Duration Monitor (BDM) diagnostic provides an accurate measure of the PAR bunch length. PAR BDM data show good agreement with streak camera measurements. The BDM is based on the metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) photodetector Hamamatsu G4176-03 MSM with specified rise and fall times of 30 ps. The BDM has sufficient frequency response to resolve the PAR bunch near extraction where; under low-charge conditions; minimum rms pulse durations of 200-300 ps are observed. Beam from the PAR is injected into the Booster; for efficient capture; injected rms bunch duration from the PAR must be less than 600 ps. The MSM detector exhibits a ringing response to fast input signals. To overcome this; the BDM output is de-convolved with the impulse response function of the detector-amplifier circuit. Turn-by-turn bunch duration data is presented versus charge and time in the PAR cycle. Charge calibration is used to determine fit parameters for bunch duration measurements in peak-detection mode. Observations relevant to APS Upgrade high-charge studies are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF006,

This requires limiting the beam emittance out of the Booster synchrotron which is achieved by operating the Booster off-momentum; thus manipulating the damping partitions. However; the much higher charge for the APS-U strongly favors injecting on momentum into the Booster for maximum acceptance. An rf-frequency ramping scheme is proposed to allow injecting on momentum and then moving the beam off momentum. The ramp is adjusted from cycle to cycle to vary the total time taken by the beam from injection to extraction; thus aligning the Booster bunch with any chosen MBA storage ring bucket. The two rf systems will not be locked at any time of the cycle. The proposed scheme is compatible with the existing synchronization of the APS injector cycle to the 60-Hz line voltage which induces a variation in the start time of the acceleration cycle. The scheme removes the need to realign the Booster ring for total path length while optimizing its operation for high charge acceleration. A ferrite tuner is being considered for dynamic tuning of the rf cavities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF007,

The inter-bunch signal pollution issue becomes significant when bunch separation is down to nanosecond and causes the position detection to be increasingly overestimated. Solely relying on extreme low Q to achieve sufficient decay within bunch interval leads to appreciable interference from non-signal modes due to strong overcoupling of antenna design is required. The error imposed on measured position raises a challenge to meet the goal of high resolution. Alternatively; a concept is proposed to remove the dominant part of signal pollution at the moment of sampling by intentionally shifting the phase of the last bunch signal 90degree respect to that of current bunch signal; where signal sampling is normally taken for nanosecond spaced bunches. This quadrature phase shift is defined by properly choosing the operational frequency of dipole mode regarding to the bunch frequency.

To achieve this goal; a special type of electron lens is being developed. It uses a hollow electron beam which co-propagates with the hadron beam to act on any halo particles without perturbing the core of the beam. The overlapping of both beams should be carefully monitored. This contribution presents the design principle and detailed characteristics of a new supersonic gas jet-based beam profile monitor. In contrast to earlier monitors; it relies on fluorescence light emitted by the gas molecules in the jet following interaction with the primary hadron beams. A dedicated prototype has been designed and built at the Cockcroft Institute and is being commissioned.

It is also key to the optimisation of the final beam quality in plasma-based acceleration. We present progress in the development of a novel RMS bunch length monitor based on imaging the coherent diffraction radiation (CDR) produced by a non-invasive circular aperture. Due to the bunch lengths involved; the radiation produced is in the THz range. This has led to the development of a novel THz imaging system; which can be applied to low energy electron beams. For high energy beams the imaging system can be used as a single shot technique. Simulation results show that the profile of a CDR image of a beam is sensitive to bunch length and can thus be used as a diagnostic. The associated benefits of this imaging distribution methodology over the typical angular distribution measurement are discussed. Plans for experiments conducted at the SwissFEL (PSI; Switzerland); along with plans for future high energy single shot measurements are also presented.,Funding: This work was supported by the EU under Grant Agreement No. 624890 and the STFC Cockcroft Institute core Grant No. ST/G008248/1.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf035_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf035.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf035_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF035,

Simulations of the expected OTR transverse beam profiles are therefore important in both the design of such imaging systems and the analysis of the data. Simulating OTR images is relatively straightforward for low energy electron beams. However; in the near future electron machines will be using high-energy and low-emittance beams. Using such parameters can be challenging to simulate; and can be limiting in their account of practical factors; e.g. chromatic aberrations. In this work we show systematically that the use of low-energy parameters in high-energy OTR image simulations induces little deviation in the resulting transverse beam profiles. Simulations therefore become much easier to perform; and further analysis may be performed. This opens up exciting opportunities to perform simulations quicker and with reduced demands on the computation requirements. It will be shown in this contribution how this approach will enable enhanced ways to optimize OTR diagnostics.,Funding: This work was supported by the EU under Grant Agreement No. 624890 and the STFC Cockcroft Institute core Grant No. ST/G008248/1.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf036_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf036.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf036_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF036,

Recently; we observed charge-dependent vertical beam size growth with a single scraper inserted through the top of the storage ring vacuum chamber. This apparent growth was due in large part to the yz coupling (vertical crabbing) induced by the wake field from the asymmetric scraper configuration. Here; we report a direct measurement of a small beam yz crabbing tilt using a streak camera. The recorded images (projected beam profiles in yz plane) are analyzed with three different methods; which yield consistent beam yz tilts. We found the directly-measured current-dependent beam tilts by the streak camera are consistent with the beam tilts calculated from a wake field model.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF042,

For a couple of years the standard machine operation has been settled at a few hundreds of pC with the tendency for smaller charges down to 100pC and smaller. The availability and resolution performance of the BPM system at charges below 300pC in many locations along the machine was unsatisfactory. In the last couple of years a new BPM electronic system based on the utca standard has been developed to overcome these limitations. A substantially improved version of the analog frontend and digital electronics has been developed in 2016 and tested successfully. During shutdown works at FLASH in summer 2017 all old button and strip-line BPM electronics has been replaced with the new type of electronics.

Small changes in dielectric properties of resonator parts destroy this balance; small reflection can be detected from the resonator. This measurement is used in electron paramagnetic resonance studies. In this paper we discuss two accelerator - related applications of this technology. First is related to beam halo measurement taking advantage of high sensitivity of the microwave measurement. High energy particles crossing the diamond inside of a tuned resonator induce a weak conductivity in the sensing material. This small change results in resonator decoupling providing a signal proportional to a number of particles crossing the diamond plate. Second application considered is the x-ray flux monitoring. In this case it is x-ray induced photoconductivity which alters resonator coupling and produces a signal. Interestingly; sensing dielectric material embedded in a resonator can be a diamond or kapton window; refractive lens or part of a silicon monochromator. Thus an inevitable x-ray absorption on optical elements of the beamline is used to monitor x-ray flux online.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF058,

Bunch length detection is a desired diagnostics for such machines. In this paper we describe a non-invasive; real-time detector which can be retrofitted into an existing beamline and measure the bunch length in real time using interferometric methods. Diffraction radiation is the mechanism to be used to produce a measurable signal without intercepting the beam. This became possible as sensitivity of pyrodetectors improved over the years; while peak beam power grew. For high peak current beams there is a possibility of a single shot measurement. This can be done with a pair of closely placed vacuum breaks that create a spatial correlation of the generated signals which can be measured by a pyro-detector array or a THz camera. The bunch length is determined from the correlation data using an iterative beam profile recovery algorithm.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf060_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf060.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf060_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF060,

The flexibility of its RF systems consisting of in total 25 RF cavities at frequencies from 400 kHz to 200 MHz allows a variety of longitudinal beam manipulations. In particular the main RF system is split into three independent groups tunable from 2.8 MHz to 10 MHz. It is used to merge; split and change the spacing between bunches by applying different voltage and phase programs to the three groups of cavities at different harmonic numbers simultaneously. The batch compression; merging and splitting (BCMS) process has been operationally used for LHC fillings since 2016. To mitigate issues with long bunch trains in the LHC in 2017; short gaps of four bunch positions have been introduced between mini-batches of eight bunches (8b4e). A higher brightness version resulting in four mini-batches per PS extraction has been delivered for luminosity production in the LHC.

Throughout the accelerator complex numerous critical subsystems; including power converters; interact with the BIS indicating their readiness for operation with beam. Power converters play a vital role in establishing operational conditions; and an unmitigated power converter malfunction could lead to damage to the machine. For example a bending magnet converter set at an incorrect current would result in an incorrect field strength; and beam passing through this may impact and damage the machine. A fast and dependable Beam Interlock Mechanism is required between power converters and BIS; verifying that voltage and current levels are within tolerances. This paper describes the design and realisation of the Beam Interlock Mechanism; based on CERN's Function Generator Controller (FGC); the central processing unit power converter control.

During the allocation process; many factors are considered to obtain so-called ‘complexity weights'; which are at the basis of the system availability allocation. Some of these factors can be measured quantitatively while other have to be assessed qualitatively. Based on our analysis of factors affecting availability; we list six criteria for complexity resulting in an availability allocation of accelerator subsystems. System experts determine the scales of factors and relationships between subsystems. In this paper; we consider four availability apportionment techniques to allocate complexity weights to subsystems.

One of the highest risks is to quench the LHC superconducting magnets in the presence of losses leading to a long machine downtime in order to recover cryogenic conditions. Smaller losses are more likely to occur and have an impact on the machine performance; reducing the luminosity production or reducing the lifetime of accelerator systems due to radiation effects; such as magnets. Understanding the characteristics of the beam loss; such as the beam and the plane; is crucial in order to correct them. Regularly during the year; dedicated loss map measurements are performed in order to validate the beam halo cleaning of the collimation system. These loss maps have the particular advantage that they are performed in well controlled conditions and can therefore be used by a machine learning algorithm to classify the type of losses during the LHC machine cycle. This study shows the result of the beam loss classification and its retrospective application to beam loss data from the 2017 run.,,B. Salvachuapresenter reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf078_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf078.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf078_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF078,

They are based on processing the signals of an electromagnetic PU for the extraction of the second-order moment; which contains information about the beam size. Despite the simplicity of the concept; quadrupololar measurements have always been highly challenging in reality. This comes from the fact that the quadrupolar moment constitutes only a very small part of the total PU signal dominated by the intensity and the position signals. Therefore; the beam size information can easily be lost due to small imperfections in the signal processing chain; such as asymmetries in the electronics and cables. In this paper; we present a new method for quadrupolar measurements using movable PUs. Through position and aperture scans; our technique minimizes the parasitic beam position signal and takes into account imperfections of the PU; cables and electronics; thus enabling an efficient auto-calibration of the measurement system. Preliminary studies; using collimators with embedded electrostatic PUs in the LHC at CERN; have shown very promising results.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf080_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf080.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf080_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF080,

While improving the already existing functionalities of quench detection for quadrupole magnets and field-bus data acquisition; the enhanced QDS will incorporate new functionalities to strengthen and improve the system operation and maintenance. The new functionalities comprise quench heater supervision; interlock loop monitoring; power cycling possibility for the whole QDS and its data acquisition part; monitoring and synchronization of trigger signals; and monitoring of power supplies. In addition; the system will have two redundant power supply feeds. Given that the enhanced QDS units will replace the existing QDS units in the LHC tunnel; the units will be exposed to elevated levels of ionizing radiation. Therefore; it is necessary to design a radiation tolerant detection system. In this work; an overview of the design solution for such enhanced QDS is presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepaf081_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepaf081.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepaf081_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAF081,

Exposed electronics and accelerator components show dose dependent accelerated aging effects. In order to achieve an optimal lifetime associated to radiation damage; the position of the equipment is chosen in dependency of the amplitude of the radiation fields. Based on the continuous analysis of the data from more than 3900 ionisation chamber beam loss monitors the evolution of the radiation levels is monitored during the accelerator operation. Normalising the radiation fields with either the integrated luminosity or the integrated intensities allows extrapolating the radiation levels of future accelerator operation. In this paper; the general radiation levels in the arcs and the insertion regions at the LHC and their evolution will be presented. The changes in the prompt dose distribution along the LHC between the operation in 2016 and 2017 will be discussed.

Curien; UMR CNRS 5516; Saint Etienne; France; The CERN's accelerator tunnels are associated with very complex mixed field radiation environments. Radiation degrades electronic components and directly affects their lifetimes causing failures that contribute to the machine downtime periods. In our contribution; we will report on the development and first employment of a Distributed Optical Fiber Radiation Sensor (DOFRS) at CERN. The most interesting feature of DOFRS technology is to provide an online and spatially distributed map of the dose levels in large machines with spatial resolution of the order of one meter. This fiber based dose sensor will provide valuable information in addition to the currently installed active and passive dosimeters. After demonstrating the working principle of DOFRS*; the first operational prototype was installed in the Proton Synchrotron Booster during last 2016/17 end-of-the-year technical stop. The DOFRS has been acquiring data successfully since the beginning of 2017 operations. The performances that were achieved by the first prototype will be discussed in the final contribution. The DOFRS measurements will also be bench-marked to the results provided by other punctual dosimeters.; *I.

The new SPS beam position read-out electronics will be based on logarithmic amplifiers; using signals provided by the 216 existing beam position monitors; the majority of which are based on split-plane 'shoebox' technology. It will need to cover a dynamic range sufficient to manage the wide range of SPS beam intensities and bunch formatting schemes to provide turn-by-turn and averaged beam orbits along the SPS acceleration cycles. In order to avoid long coaxial cables; the front-end electronics including the digitisation; will be located inside the accelerator tunnel; with optical transmission to surface processing electronics.

Differential current measurements with several ACCT pairs are foreseen to detect beam losses particularly in the low-energy linac where Beam Loss Monitors cannot be used. The ACCTs will also be used to check that no beam will be present in the sections downstream of a temporary beam dump. These measurements will then be used to stop the beam shortly after an abnormal condition has been detected by the BCM system. This will require some customized interfaces with the Timing System and the Machine Protection System as well as an optical interface for differential current measurement over large distances. Automatic setting of the machine protection thresholds and masking/unmasking of the interlocks based on the beam and destination modes are among the technical complexities.

Often the orbit of the beam through the MI8 line differs depending on the beam destination. The beam is collimated in the MI8 line; so increasing intensities and repetition rates make controlling orbits through the collimators a necessity. The current method of regulating the MI8 line orbit with DC corrector settings is insufficient.

An estimate of sources of inherent power supply ripples along with ripple magnitude are thus obtained. Spill characterization in time and frequency domain are discussed and exemplified by a typical spill and the differences from an ideal or Poisson spill.

For theoretical investigations of the TRIBs a reliable nonlinear optics of the machine is required and thus all measurable global observables for the nonlinear optics are of great interest. The measurement of the TSWA for the BESSY II standard optics was performed using an injection kicker to excite high amplitude betatron oscillations and then extract the amplitude dependant frequency from the synchrotron radiation damped oscillation with a Hilbert transformation. With TRIBs optics the injection kicker was not able to sufficienty excite the beam. The impact and correctability of the BPM nonlinearity at the reached amplitudes and the reason for the failure of the excitation method for our TRIBs optics shall be looked onto in this paper. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepak010_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepak010.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepak010_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAK010,

Hardware-in-the-loop simulations; where an actual cavity is replaced by an electronics system; can help to solve this issue. In this paper we present a Cavity Simulator imple-mented in a National Instruments PXI equipped with an FPGA module. This module operates with one intermedi-ate frequency input which is IQ-demodulated and fed to the electrical cavity's model; where the transmitted and re-flected voltages are calculated and IQ-modulated to gener-ate two intermediate frequency outputs. Some more ad-vanced features such as mechanical vibration modes driven by Lorentz-force detuning or external microphonics have also been implemented.

Since each ring requires different injection energy; magnetic field in the LINAC has to be changed shot by shot (every 20 ms) according to the destination of the beam. To realize such operation; a PXI express based new control system was installed. Each unit; which consists of an event receiver board; a DAC board; and a ADC board; can set and monitor output current up to 8 pulsed power supply in 16 bit resolution. The timing and control system are integrated in that of the LINAC by using Micro-Research Finland's PXI event receiver board. In terms of software; Windows 8.1 and LabVIEW 2016 were mainly adopted to control the hardware. EPICS channel access (CA) protocol was used to communicate with operator's interface panels. In addition to real-time monitoring by EPICS CA and logging by CSS archiver every 10 s; data are logged every shot (every 20 ms) in the text file together with timestamp; shot ID and destination.

Also; the septum and kicker magnets for injection point of main ring are controlled with this Beam Gate to avoid unnecessary operation and to prolong their lifetime. The Beam Gate synchronizes the enabling and disabling operations of these hardware even though they are about 1km distant. Besides; from the phase-2 operation; the kicker and septum magnets for newly constructed damping ring becomes controlled apparatus of this system. We develop the new Beam Gate control system with the Event Timing System network*. The new system improves the unsatisfied performance of Beam Gate in the phase-1 operation and realizes the complicated control for phase-2.

This was so as to allow operation of the downstream part for beam injection into photon factory rings while construction and development of new electron guns proceed in the upstream part. In summer of 2017; this arrangement was revised and the entire injector linac was reconsolidated into a single radiation control area. This was in conjunction with the introduction of the 1.1 GeV positron damping ring for Phase-II operation of SuperKEKB and successful development of new electron RF guns in the far upstream part of the linac. Along with this reconsolidation; the personnel and machine protection system was modified and improved. Interlock signal lines for the damping ring and RF guns were added. The operation panel of the main console was modified accordingly. In addition; the screen displays of the interlock status were updated.

In order to obtain bunch by bunch position measurements; four cavity beam position monitors (cBPM) near the two interaction points are foreseen. Extensive tests on the cBPM read-out electronics; recently developed by Instrumentation Technologies and acquired for ELI-NP GBS; were performed in laboratory at INFN-LNF and at FLASH in DESY; during the user operation. In the latter case; three cBPMs installed along the LINAC; with similar features as the ones of ELI-NP GBS; were used as measuring devices and signal sources for the read-out electronics under test.

Generated luminescence or ions by passing the beam through the gas sheet has the information of cross-section shape of the beam. The gas sheet beam monitor will become a useful tool to measure the profile of high power beams because it has no breakable element such as wires and a 2-D beam profile at a certain position of beam line can be immediately obtained by just injecting the gas. Previously; the development of the gas sheet generator and successful demonstration of the beam profile measurement were reported. This time; we applied a gas sheet monitor to J-PARC LINAC; where the negative hydrogen atoms (H−) are accelerated to the energy of 400 MeV in the normal operation. Most challenging factor was the development of the gas sheet monitor system; which generates the enough dense gas sheet to detect the clear image of the beam profile without harmful effect on the ultra-high vacuum in the beam line. We will report the gas sheet beam monitor system for J-PARC LINAC and the results of the first measurement of the beam profile.; * N.

Since the malfunction of operation occurred in the control system of the RCS collimator drive system in 2016; we decided to improve the motor control system. As a cause of malfunction; it is considered that aging of control equipment is one of them as J-PARC has been operated for more than 10 years. However; the defect did not occur in the reproduction test. Therefore; it can be considered that a malfunction occurred in the VME control system due to abnormality of the semiconductor element due to radiation ray. Then; in the improved motor control system; PLC with FA* specification with high reliability was adopted as the control device. Also; in case of unexpected event that a malfunction occurred in the PLC; the emergency stop mechanism was developed to stop the drive system by the signal of the limit switch; and a system incorporating it was constructed.

To make a gas sheet; we use the beaming effect; which is well known in vacuum science and technology. The emitted molecules through a long rectangular channel; which has a very small ratio of the gap to the width; are forced to concentrate on a plane. The gas sheet with a thickness of 1.5 mm and the density of 2×10-4 Pa was easily generated by the combination of the deep slit and the thin slit. Here; the gas sheet was produced by the deep slit; and the shape of the sheet was improved by the thin slit. The usefulness of this monitor was shown by the following experiments: 1) For the electron beam of 30 keV with a diameter greater than 0.35 mm; the position and the two-dimensional profiles were well measured using the gas sheet. 2) Then the profiles of the 10 and 400 MeV proton beam with a current of several microamperes were well measured; too. 3) Recently; the profiles of the 400 MeV H− ion beams in J-PARC linac were measured.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepal018_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepal018.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepal018_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAL018,

For certain investigations it is necessary to use a pulsed beam (macro pulses; several milliseconds). Up to now this pulsed mode can only be applied if the beam loading for the accelerating RF structures is negligible. To achieve higher pulse intensities the accelerator RF infrastructure needs to be equipped with feed-forward techniques to compensate for the expected beam loading. To monitor beam losses the machine protection system at MAMI needs to be extended to be able to localize fast occurrences of beam losses.

The KIT storage ring KARA (KArlsruhe Research Accelerator) is the first storage ring in the world that has a near-field EO bunch-profile monitor in operation. By imprinting longitudinal electron bunch profiles onto chirped laser pulses; single-shot detection is feasible. However; limitations of available detection systems are challenging: The constraints are either given by the repetition rate or the duration of the consecutive acquisitions. Two strategies can overcome these limitations: Based on the photonic time-stretch method; the ps laser pulses can be stretched to the ns range using km long fibers. The readout with a high-bandwidth oscilloscope then enables a single-shot detection at high repetition rates. The other strategy is the development of dedicated ultra-fast photodetector arrays allowing direct detection of the ps pulses at MHz repetition rates. We developed KALYPSO; a linear detector array with a DAQ allowing to record high data-rates over long time scales.

In the highest dose area; the radiation comes mainly from hard X-rays produced by synchrotron bending magnets. During beam cleaning and after replacing a vacuum chamber; losses due to inelastic Coulomb scattering occur mostly downstream from bending magnets while elastic scattering causes electrons to get lost mainly after an elliptically polarizing undulator which has a limited vertical aperture. During the injection period; the beam loss pattern can be changed by modifying injection conditions or lattice settings. The beam loss usually happens in the injection section and small-aperture section.

The waveform of the the four kickers have strong relation with injection efficiency. A slightly offset of waveform may cause the four kickers mismatched; which would lead to storaged beam loss and decrease injection efficiency. In order to define the peak value and timing of the half-sine waveform which has noises interfering diagnosis; a curve-fitting method was introduced to monitor and fine-tuning the waveform. The waveforms' data are also archived for reference in case of replacing power supplies.

Up to recently; the number of turns had to be measured using radial probes; which cannot be performed during user operation but only during beam development shifts. For user shifts; the estimate of the number of turns was based on the acceleration voltage measurements; with the inherent limited precision of RF measurements. A new scheme based on the time of flight (ToF) measurements has been deployed on the two cyclotrons of HIPA. It is based on the cross-correlation of fast sampled data from pickups located at the entrance and at the exit of the cyclotrons. For the first cyclotron; called Injector 2 (accelerating the beam from 870 keV to 72MeV); the beam had to be externally modulated whereas; for the Ring Cyclotron (72 MeV to 590 MeV); no external modulation was necessary. This paper will present the details of both implementations; their limitations and the quality of the results that can be obtained with the ToF techniques.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepal067_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepal067.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepal067_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAL067,

A key issue of this facility is to ensure safe operation of the SINQ spallation source. In particular; too large beam current density and/or inaccurate beam steering can seriously compromise the integrity of the spallation target. Recently; a campaign has been launched in order to improve the fast detection of improper beam delivery and therefore the reliability of the system. New beam diagnostics elements such as an absolute intensity monitor; a beam ellipticity monitor and additional loss monitors have been installed during the 2017 shutdown. In 2018 a new SINQ target will be installed featuring a system of thermocouples which will keep track of the beam position. Moreover; an additional monitor is currently under study which should reliably detect small beam fractions accidentally bypassing the muon production target TE and which are intrinsically dangerous for the SINQ spallation target. This contribution reviews the all efforts to increase the efficiency of the SINQ protection system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepal068_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepal068.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepal068_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAL068,

The Driven Modal analysis from the simulation tool ANSYS HFSS was used for parametric model development and to optimize design parameters such as e.g. the position of the inductively coupled pick-ups. A ceramic plate has been inserted in the resonator gap to relax the precision required during manufacturing.

The beam line users has been performing various tests including pump-probe X-ray scattering; time-resolved x-ray liquidography; etc in the hard x-ray beam line since March 22. The energy and flux of x-ray photon beam generated from XFEL and synchronization timing should be stable to ensure successful time-resolved tests. Several parts that comprise the large scientific equipment should be installed and operated at precise three-dimensional location coordinates X; Y; and Z through survey and alignment to ensure their optimal performance. As time goes by; however; the ground goes through uplift and subsidence; which consequently changes the coordinates of installed components and leads to alignment errors ΔX; ΔY; and ΔZ. As a result; the system parameters change; and the performance of the large scientific equipment deteriorates accordingly. Measuring the change in locations of systems comprising the large scientific equipment in real time would make it possible to predict alignment errors; locate any region with greater changes; realign components in the region fast; and shorten the time of survey and alignment. For this purpose; a HLS's (hydrostatic leveling sensor) with 0.2um of resolution are installed and operated in a waterpipe of total length 1km in the PAL-XFEL building.

Such laserwires typically measure a 1D beam profile and/or 2D transverse emittance from the products of photo-detached ions as a laser beam is scanned across the H− beam. For laser pulse durations (~80ns) longer than the RF period (~3ns); the detector integrates many complete bunches; enabling only transverse beam monitoring. This paper presents a new technique to capture a series of time resolved transverse emittance measurements along the bunch train. A fast (~10ps) pulsed laser photo-detaches ions within each bunch and is synchronized to sample consecutive bunches at certain longitudinal positions along each bunch. A fast detector records the spatial distribution and time-of-flight of the neutralized H0; thus both the transverse and longitudinal emittance are reconstructed. We present simulations of a time varying pulsed laser field interacting within an H− bunch; and estimate the yield; spatial and time distributions of H0 arriving at the detector.

After the successful R&D program; the preliminary designs were performed to further improve the performance and to finalize the schematics; the PCB layouts; and the power supply constructions. The two types of the power supplies share the majority of the designs and features; with minor differences for the different bandwidth requirement. This paper presents the preliminary design; the key power supply functions and features; and the test results.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF008,

In that case; beam loading is zero for an on-axis beam. The crab cavity system of the future electron-ion collider eRHIC will manipulate 275 GeV proton beams. At high energies; the beam offset can be as large as 2 mm (including mechanical and electrical offset tolerances). The beam loading resulting from such offset can greatly incur in large power requirements to the RF amplifier. The choice of external Q for the Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) is critical to limit the power requirement to practical values. The loaded Q of the eRHIC crab cavities is mainly governed by the external Q of the FPC; so the external Q will also define the cavity bandwidth and thus the tuning requirements to counteract frequency transients from external perturbations. This paper discusses the choice of external Q for the FPC of the eRHIC crab cavities and introduces the design of a preliminary FPC antenna concept that would provide the appropriate external Q.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF012,

EIC IR superconducting quadrupole coils must provide strong focusing gradients; leading to large peak fields; for the high momentum hadron beam while permitting the nearby electron beam to pass through a nearly field free region. An actively shielded coil geometry does this using nested; opposite polarity; quadrupoles where the combined external fields cancel while leaving a net gradient inside. In order to fabricate and test this concept in a timely and cost effective manner we propose to reuse the inner coils from an existing high gradient Nb3Sn LARP quadrupole inside a new structure with a new NbTi active shield coil. The main challenge is to design a compact structure for applying prestress to the Nb3Sn coil that fits the restricted space inside the shield coil. We first construct a 15 cm long mechanical model of this structure with coil strain gauges to verify the design concept before proceeding with the full coil.

High fields are readily achieved by using small magnet gaps. This is possible due to the small beam sizes involved. Reduction in the physical aperture and the reduction in the good field region requirements results in magnets with compact transverse dimensions. The very strong focusing of the magnets results in very small drift spaces between the various magnetic elements. To keep these drift spaces clear magnets with recessed coils have been studied. In such magnets the coils do not stick out beyond the end of the magnet yoke in the longitudinal direction. By placing the coils on the outer yoke loss of efficiency can be avoided while maintaining good control of the higher order field harmonics. This is very well suited for quadrupole magnets where only two coils are required. Possible designs for gradient dipoles and sexutpoles are also considered. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf021.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF021,

In this work we present a computational method to convert a measured Q0 vs. Hpeak to a more accurate Rs vs. Hlocal; given knowledge about cavity geometry and field distribution.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf042_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf042.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf042_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF042,

Gurevich of the anti-Q-slope (a field-dependent decrease of the microwave surface resistance) and experimental results from impurity-doped niobium. As a corollary; the model predicts that a strong DC magnetic field applied parallel to the RF surface will produce a similar decrease in surface resistance. In order to explore this prediction for many materials; we have designed a new coaxial cavity with a strong; uniform DC field superimposed over a weak RF field on a removable and replaceable niobium sample.

They are operated at 1.3 GHz. The RF peak power is 5 MW at 650 us pulse width and 10 Hz repetition rate. In order to understand the multipacting that occurs during conditioning; it was simulated in the RF window type that is used for the electron gun in the XFEL. The reduction in secondary emission yield associated with conditioning was taken into account. Since the RF windows are tested with high power on a test stand before their use; without the electron gun; measurement results are available which are compared with the simulation results. The main advantage of the simulation compared to the measurement is that the locations of multipacting can be determined in the RF window. This could be helpful for the development of high-power RF components in the future; in order to detect pronounced multipacting resonances even before production and to avoid them by design changes.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF051,

The first modulator began operation in 2014 and the start of linac was beginning 2017. The R&D phase for the modulators started directly with the development of superconducting cavities. Besides the pulse generation; the modulator had to suppress the 10 Hz repetition rate in order not to disturb the grid. Another unique demand was the development of pulse cables. Since the power RF had to be generated in the tunnel; the klystrons were installed near the cavities. However; the modulators had to be installed outside of the tunnel for space; maintenance reasons and radiation concerns. This transmission of high power pulses via long cables is unique in the world and the suppression of EMI effects was mandatory.

Data depicting the cavity signal behavior is currently only saved manually. This either happens; when cavity tests are being performed; or an operator detects a fault in the cavity system; that has to be further investigated. Those instances of interest are neither systematically nor automatically stored. It can therefore be assumed that unwanted or degraded cavity behavior is detected late or not at all. It is proposed to change the focus from detecting known faults (such as quenches) to additionally detect anomalies in the cavity system behavior. In order to detect anomalies in the cavity signals; an algorithm is proposed using a cavity model. It aims on finding those data sets; which diverge from the nominal cavity behavior; saving those instances for later analysis. The nominal behavior is defined by the cavity electromagnetic resonance model with beam loading as well as the model for the mechanical oscillations due to the Lorentz Forces. By using such an approach; the detection of anomalies; as well as faults could be automated. This contribution aims to summarize the influence of beam loading on the detection and gives examples for anomalies that were found in several cavities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf058_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf058.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf058_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF058,

There are multiple candidates for achieving high gradient focusing fields; each one having certain drawbacks. Permanent magnets are limited in tunability; plasma lenses might degrade the transverse beam quality significantly and conventional magnets cannot reach very high gradients and often cannot be placed in direct proximity of the plasma accelerator because of their size.

During conditioning; the cavities are detuned in order to sweep the standing wave through the waveguide. To match these cavities at lower voltage (typically < 1.4 MV) and at higher power; 3 stub tuners are used in the waveguide feed. Simulations with CST studio show that a strong SW field exists between the RF window and the matching posts. As the cavity is detuned the electric field maximum passes through the window causing heating of the ceramic. Temperature measurements with thermal camera reveal that the temperature of the window increases to maximum when the cavity is detuned towards higher frequency. Based on the simulation results and the measurements; it was decided to reduce the conditioning voltage.

Splitting the accelerator structure into two sections along the beam axis allows for a significant reduction in part count and vacuum joint length. The resultant single and coplanar vacuum joint between the two split sections allows for joining techniques such as electron beam welding or brazing of the parts to form the accelerator vacuum envelope. High precision alignment of the two sections is achieved through an elastic averaging interface coupling where improved accuracy is derived from the averaging of errors over a large number of relatively compliant contacting members. The monoblock split sections allow for highly optimized cooling configurations with enhanced heat removal in high heat flux regions; reducing vacuum wall thermal stresses and enabling higher power operation.

The simplification comes from two innovations: utilization of LCLS gun type RF design to avoid an expensive brazing process and copper plating of stainless steel that further reduces manufacturing cost. This is realized by a special structure design where accelerating structure cells are made out of copper plated stainless steel with knife edges and structure irises - copper disks acts also as gaskets for vacuum and RF seal. Besides the reduced cost; brazeless assembly allows integration of effective cooling and magnet optics elements into accelerator cells.

This feature constrains the cavity shunt impedance (efficiency) to relatively small values. As microwave power flows through the accelerating cells in such structures; the probability of breakdown in high gradient operation is greatly increased. In this paper we present results from an accelerating structure prototype with distributed microwave coupling; an approach invented at SLAC. These structures include one or more parallel waveguides which are loaded by accelerating cavities. In this configuration accelerating cavities are fed independently and completely isolated at the beam pipe. Thus there is no microwave power flow through the accelerating cavity; making this geometry favorable for high gradient operation and maximizing the shunt impedance.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf069_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf069.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf069_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF069,

To be able to achieve the small horizontal emittance of the ALS-U; the three bend achromats in the ALS will be replaced with nine bend achromats. Because the lifetime of the ALS-U beam will be significantly reduced; the plan is to use a swap out injection scheme between the storage ring and a new accumulator ring. The present plan is to use individual power supplies for each magnet in the storage ring; and series connected magnet strings for the accumulator ring. The sheer number of supplies needed; along with the tighter stability requirements for the ALS-U; is demanding in terms of the power supply requirements for stability and reliability.

Increased energy; intensity and adapted beam operation schemes with 25 ns of inter-bunches spacing have an essential influence on the dynamic heat load generation with direct impact on the cryogenic cooling system. In order to cope with significantly higher than expected beam induced thermal load; the cryogenic system was tuned and optimized to adapt the required refrigeration capacity to the beam operational requirements. The most challenging part of tuning was focused on the dynamic heat load compensation on the beam screens circuits. The paper will provide the overview on the main differences between the theoretical heat load values considered for initial design and the on-line measurements performed on cryogenic LHC sectors.

A significant weak point of conventional kicker systems is often the pulse generator, where a Pulse Forming Network/Line (PFN/PFL) is discharged through a thyratron switch to generate the current pulse for the kicker magnet. This design has several disadvantages: in particular the occasional erratic turn-on of the switch which cannot be accepted for the FCC. A potential replacement is the inductive adder (IA) that uses semiconductor switches and distributed capacitors as energy storage. The modular design, low maintenance and high flexibility make the IA a very interesting alternative. In addition, the ability to both turn-on and off the current also permits the replacement of PFN/PFL by the capacitors. A first FCC prototype IA, capable of generating 9 kV and 2.4 kA pulses, has been designed and built at CERN. It will be upgrade to a full-scale prototype (15 kV, 2.4 kA) in 2018.

Pre-damping rings and damping rings (DRs) will produce ultra-low emittance beam with high bunch charge. The DR kicker systems must provide extremely stable field pulses to avoid beam emittance increase. The DR extraction kicker system consists of a stripline kicker and two pulse modulators. Specifications for the electromagnetic field pulses require that the modulator produce pulses of 160 or 900 ns flattop duration; ±12.5 kV and 305 A; with ripple and droop of not more than ±0.02 % (±2.5 V) with respect to an ideal waveform. Inductive adder topology has been chosen for the pulse modulators where the output waveform can be adjusted by applying analogue modulation methods. Two full-scale; 20-layer; 12.5 kV prototype inductive adders have been designed and built; and they are being tested at CERN.

Shock and vibration issues are a key element for their successful transport; handling operations around the CERN infra-structure; as well as for their operation underground. The experimental modal analysis measurement technique is performed to validate the Finite Element Analysis in the case of complex structures (with cables and substructure coupling). In the case of lightweight structures; standard contact measurements based on accelerometers are not possible due to the high mass ratio between the accelerometers and the structure itself. In such a case; the vibration of the structure can be calculated based on the Doppler shift of the laser beam reflected off the vibrating surface.

A magnetic Horn (AD-Horn) in the AD target area is used to focus the diverging antiproton beam and increase the antiproton yield enormously. The horn is pulsed with a current of 400 kA; generated by capacitor discharge type generators equipped with ignitrons. These mercury-filled devices present a serious danger of environmental pollution in case of accident and safety constraints. An alternative has been developed using solid-state switches and diodes.

These kickers are often ferrite loaded transmission line type magnets with a rectangular shaped aperture through which the beam passes. The interaction of the beam with the resistive part of the longitudinal beam coupling impedance leads to power dissipation and heating of different elements in the accelerator ring. In particular; power deposition in the kicker magnets can be a limitation: if the temperature of the ferrite yoke exceeds the Curie temperature; the beam will not be properly deflected. In addition; the imaginary portion of the beam coupling impedance contributes to beam instabilities. A good knowledge of electromagnetic properties of materials up to GHz frequency range is essential for a correct impedance evaluation. This paper presents the results of transmission line measurements of complex initial permeability and permittivity for different ferrite types. We present an approach for deriving electromagnetic properties as a function of both frequency and temperature; this information is required for simulating ferrite behaviour under realistic operating conditions.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmf089_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmf089.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmf089_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMF089,

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment will undergo the biggest upgrade of its experimental beam vacuum system since the first operations in 2008. The new experimental vacuum layout should comply with demanding structural; vacuum; integration and physics requirements. Moreover; the new layout should be compatible with foreseen engineering changes of the detector and the machine during the upgrade phase of High-Luminosity LHC in LS3.

The dumps are installed as active elements in the lattice in straight sections between the main bending magnets. The dumps are moved into the beam when requested by operation and shave the circulating beam turn by turn stopping the beam after about 6 ms. The shaving induces a very localized beam energy deposition on the dump surface in a thickness of tens of microns. A completely new approach has been developed with FLUKA to simulate beam shaving; coupled with ANSYS to define a new dump core design. This paper presents the design of the dump based on operational constraints such as cycling 200 000 times per year for 20 years; limited access for maintenance or reaching the beam trajectory in 150 ms. These constraints had a major impact on the technological choices. The new dump core is made of a low-density graphite block followed by a denser copper alloy (CuCr1Zr) one. Water circuits; bonded with Hot Isostatic Pressing; are cooling the core in ultra-high vacuum. The core is moved by a spring-based actuation mechanism.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmg001_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmg001.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmg001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMG001,

An inspection in 2013 revealed significant beam induced damage to the aluminium absorbing block; resulting in operational limitations to minimize the risk of reproducing this phenomenon. Additionally; in 2016 a vacuum leak was detected in the dump assembly; which imposed further limitations; i.e.; a reduction of the beam intensity that could be dumped. In the winter stop of 2016-2017; a new version of the TIDVG (featuring several design modifications) was installed. This paper analyses the performance of the dump observed during the commissioning period and subsequent operation in 2017 of the most recent installed version of the TIDVG. The temperature measurements recorded during this time were used to benchmark numerical models that allow predicting the performance of the dump under different conditions.

These magnets will be powered through a novel superconducting link based on MgB2 cables. One option for the powering layout of this triplet circuit is the use of cryogenic bypass diodes; where the diodes are located inside an extension to the magnet cryostat and operated in superfluid helium. Hence; they are exposed to radiation. For this reason the radiation hardness of existing LHC type bypass diodes and more radiation tolerant prototype diodes needs to be tested up to the radiation doses expected at their planned position during their lifetime. A first irradiation test is planned in CERN's CHARM facility starting in spring 2018. Therefore; a cryo-cooler based cryostat to irradiate and test LHC type diodes in-situ has been designed and constructed.

After a successful impedance mitigation campaign during LS1; the MKI ferrite yokes have remained below their Curie point and have not limited LHC's availability. However; for HL-LHC operation the MKI yokes are expected to exceed their Curie temperatures after long physics runs. To ensure uninterrupted future HL-LHC operation; a modified beam screen design; relocating some of the heat load to more easily cooled parts; and a suitable cooling system are under development as the current baseline for the HL-LHC upgrade of the MKIs. An upgraded beam screen providing such relocation has been designed; simulated and compared to the existing model.

In addition; in the event that it is necessary to exchange an injection kicker magnet; the newly installed kicker magnet would limit HL-LHC operation for a few hundred hours due to dynamic vacuum activity. Extensive studies have been carried out to identify practical solutions to these problems: these include redistributing a significant portion of the beam induced power deposition to ferrite parts of the kicker magnet which are not at pulsed high voltage and water cooling of these parts. Furthermore a surface coating; to mitigate dynamic vacuum activity; has been selected.

Beam-screen upgrades; implemented during Long Shutdown 1 (LS1); have been very effective in reducing beam coupling impedance and since then the MKIs have not limited LHC's availability. However; temperature measurements during operation have shown that one end of the MKI's ferrite yoke is consistently hotter than the other. Detailed simulation models and data post-processing algorithms have been developed to understand and mitigate the observed behaviour. In the present paper; the model used to obtain the power loss distribution along the magnet is presented.

Horizontal crabbing is obtained with a radio-frequency dipole cavity (RFD) designed by Old Do-minion University (ODU); SLAC and Fermilab (FNAL). In this paper a new mechanical design; that uses passive stiffeners; is presented. This design leads to a decrease of the Lorentz Force Detuning frequency shift; satisfy the requirements on pressure sensitivity; validate the structural integrity and increase the tuner sensitivity and the maximum elastic tuning range. Furthermore; it will be possible to greatly simplify the shape of the magnetic shield and Helium vessel with respect to the current design.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepmk014_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepmk014.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepmk014_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPMK014,

Testing indicated that this was a difference in the mechanical support of cavity 1; not a local acoustic source. Further investigation pointed to the upstream beam-pipe of the cavity 1. The upstream cavity flange has a solid spool piece connection to the beamline gate valve unlike the other cavities; which all connect through bellows. The gate valve's weight is supported by sliding system (free in z-axis) connected to large diameter Helium gas return pipe. The tuner design was modified to transform interface between cavity#1 and gate valve.

It was verified that the anti-Q-slope is consequence of the decreasing of the temperature-dependent component of the surface resistance as a function of the field. This trend is opposite compared to the increasing of the surface resistance previously observed in 1.3 GHz standard (EP; BCP; 120 C baked) niobium cavities. The effect of the different state-of-the-art surface treatments on the field dependence of the surface resistance is studied for 650 MHz; 1.3 GHz; 2.6 GHz and 3.9 Ghz cavities.

In hadron colliders; they are used needed for beam separation before and after interaction points. In a muon collider; they are considered for both the arc and the interaction regions to provide room for internal absorbers protecting magnets from the muon decay products. These magnets can also be used in test facilities to produce a background magnetic field for testing conductor samples or insert coils. High level of magnetic field and large aperture size lead to large Lorentz forces and mechanical strains and stresses which can damage brittle Nb3Sn coils.

The paper focusses on the cavity part and its cooling issues as well as the broadband characteristics. Due the lossy magnetic alloy ring core filling; which consists of high permeability Finemet FT3M ring cores (HITACHI); the cavities show a broadband behaviour and thus no cavity tuning during the acceleration ramp is necessary. To keep the bandwidth of the cavities as broad as possible they are cooled by a special mineral oil with low permittivity.

Due to leakage of a magnetic field at a circulating beam passing through a saturated iron area; high field septum magnets with this concept is not feasible. Thus; this conventional design approach is limited magnetic field strength below 2 Tesla. For high energy machines; like SIS300 at FAIR or FCC at CERN; high field septum magnets are required to shorten the injection and extraction branch lines. Recently superconducting magnets; which enable to reduce the size of a building; are being introduced to medical accelerators. However; even if bending magnets are replaced by high field magnets; long straight sections; which is partly composed by a conventional septum magnet; remain. By introducing high field septum magnets; more compact accelerator can be designed. To get over the limitation of 2 Tesla; a novel concept of a septum magnet generating high magnetic field has been developed and design studies are ongoing. By using superconducting technology; a septum magnet can be designed to generate more than 2 Tesla.

F. Bohlender; M. Iberler; J. Jacoby; IAP; Frankfurt am Main; Germany; Goethe Universität Frankfurt; Frankfurt am Main; Germany; This contribution shows the progress in the development of a plasma window at the institute for applied physics at Goethe University Frankfurt. A plasma window* is a membrane free transition between two regions of different pressure; enabling beam transmission from a rough vacuum area (~1 mbar) to a higher pressure (up to 1 bar) region on short length scales. In comparison to differential pumping stages a length reduction by a factor of up to 100 is achievable; while the absence of a solid membrane yields prolonged operation time. The sealing effect is based on the high temperature arc discharge sustained in a cooled copper channel between the pressure regimes. Due to a bulk temperature around 10; 000K** the viscosity of the gas is dramatically increased; leading to a slower gas flow; enabling a higher pressure gradient. This contribution will present first results regarding the pressure gradient in dependence of the discharge current and the aperture. Until now; a pressure factor around 100 has been established for well over 50 min. This contribution goes along with the one from Mr. A.

The proton-proton collider center-of-mass collision energy is set to 100 TeV with a beam current of 0.5 A. To reach this goal a stable acceleration is critical and therefore higher order modes (HOM) need to be damped. To avoid a high power level in the HOM dampers; further described as couplers; the loaded Q-factor should be below 1000 for the cavity with mounted HOM couplers. Besides a low Q-factor the R/Q value should also be in the range of 1 Ω or below. Two different types of couplers are used to achieve a high damping. The two types are a narrowband Hook-type HOM coupler and a broadband Probe-type HOM coupler. The recent results of the design of the HOM couplers attached to a superconducting 400 MHz RF cavity will be presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/wepml044_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/wepml044.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/wepml044_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPML044,

The DR is a racetrack-shaped storage ring with a circumference of 135.5 m; in which the 1.1 GeV positron beam is stored for 40 ms to damp the emittance. The maximum stored beam current is 70.8 mA. Required beam lifetime due to residual gas scattering is longer than 1000 s and the average pressure should be lower than 10-5 Pa. Non-evaporable getter (NEG) pumps are mainly used; and the average effective pumping speed for CO is expected to be 0.013 m3s−1m-1 immediately after NEG activation. The beam pipes are made of aluminum alloy; and have antechambers to deal with synchrotron radiation (critical energy 0.8-0.9 keV; total power 7.2 kW) in arc sections; which are effective in reducing the electron cloud and the impedance of the beam pipes.

Their effect limits LHC availability by causing premature dumps due to excessive beam losses and occasionally even magnet quenches. This could become an important limitation for future accelerators such as the High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) and the Future Circular Collider (FCC). The dynamics of these UFOs was investigated in two dedicated experiments. In the first experiment; it was shown that the transverse movements of these particles can be studied by observing bunch-by-bunch losses from bunches with different horizontal and vertical emittances. In the second experiment; UFO-like events around the 16L2 interconnect in the LHC; which has seen intense UFO activity in 2017; were studied with the above method.

Usual methods to control the instabilities; such as octupole magnets; beam feedback dampers and use of chromatic effects; become less effective and insufficient. We show that; in contrast; Lorentz forces of a low-energy; magnetically stabilized electron beam; or ""electron lens""; easily introduces transverse nonlinear focusing sufficient for Landau damping of transverse beam instabilities in accelerators.

For example; the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) upgrade; LCLS-II; is considering complex schemes such as two-color operation [1]; while the plasma wake field acceleration facility for advanced accelerator experimental tests (FACET) upgrade; FACET-II; is planning on providing custom tailored current profiles [2]. Because of uncertainty due to limited diagnostics and time varying performance; such as thermal drifts; as well as collective effects and the complex coupling of large numbers of components; it is impossible to use simple look up tables for parameter settings in order to quickly switch between widely varying operating ranges. Several forms of artificial intelligence are currently being investigated in order to enable accelerators to quickly and automatically re-adjust component settings without human intervention.

The MR has two extraction modes; fast extraction (FX) for the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment; T2K; and slow extraction (SX) for experiments in the hadron experimental facility. At present; achieved beam intensities are 2.4·1014 protons per pulse (ppp) with cycle time 2.48 s (470 kW) in the FX mode and 5.1013 ppp with cycle time 5.52 s (44 kW) in the SX mode. For the FX operation; recent improvements are settings of new betatron tune; corrections of resonances near the betatron tune; and adopting 2nd harmonic rf voltage to reduce space charge effect. Beam instabilities have been suppressed with controlling chromaticity correction and transverse feedback systems.

These distributions in absorbed photon energy and incident angle are used as input to Geant4-based simulations of electron emission from the walls. The average quantum efficiency is found to vary dramatically with the location of the absorption site; owing to the distribution in impact energies and angles.

As it is well known; the dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance of these kinds of lattices are dramatically reduced due to the increase of the sextupoles strengths to compensate its strong focusing. The reduction of the dynamic aperture jeopardizes the current off-axis injection system and lower beam lifetimes increase the beam instabilities and the radiation safety concerns of the storage ring. MOGA searches the best settings of quadrupoles and sextupoles in a multi-dimensional parameter space taking into account the dynamic properties and the natural emittance as objectives at the level of ten picometers.

PETRA IV should provide a natural emittance two orders of magnitude smaller as now. The energy and the current of 100 mA should be unchanged. Currently different lattice options are investigated to achieve an emittance in the range of 10-30 pm*rad. As one candidate for a lattice of PETRA IV a ring based on the concept of hybrid multi-bend achromats (HMBA) has been studied in detail. Due to the unique layout of PETRA III with long straight sections it is possible to use damping wigglers to reduce the emittance further. While this helps to mitigate intrabeam scattering it has the disadvantage of an increased energy spread.

In order to study their effect on the beam dynamics a special collimator has been built and installed in the machine. Its jaws are coated with three different materials and can be moved transversely to selectively expose the beam to the chosen coating. We have measured the resistive wall tune shifts of each coating material and compared them with that of a standard Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) collimator jaw. A resolution of the tune shift of the order of 10-5 has been achieved in the measurement. The results show a significant reduction of the resistive wall tune shift with novel materials. The largest improvement is obtained with a 5 μm Molybdenum coating of a Molybdenum-Graphite jaw.

Several rf systems in a frequency range from 2.8 MHz to 200 MHz are available for beam acceleration and manipulations. Each of the six bunches injected from the PS Booster is split in several steps into 12 bunches spaced by 25 ns; yielding a batch of 72 bunches at transfer to the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). In the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project the bunch intensity must be doubled. However; with most of the planned upgrades already in place this intensity has not yet been achieved due to collective effects. One of them is uncontrolled longitudinal emittance blow-up during the bunch splittings. In this contribution; measurements of the blow-up during the splitting process are presented and compared with particle simulations using the present PS impedance model. Beam-based measurements of the impedances of the rf cavities have been performed.

A bunch-to-bucket transfer is performed with the main drawback that the rf frequency in the SPS (200 MHz) is five times higher than the one in the PS (40 MHz). The PS bunches are therefore shortened non-adiabatically before extraction by applying a fast rf voltage increase (bunch rotation) to fit them into the short rf buckets in the SPS. However; particles with large amplitude of synchrotron oscillations in the PS longitudinal phase space are not properly captured in the SPS. They contribute to losses at the injection plateau and at the start of acceleration in the SPS. In this contribution; we present measurements and simulations performed to identify the source of the uncaptured particles. The tails of the particle distribution were characterized by applying longitudinal shaving during acceleration.

In this paper the obtained tolerances for stray fields in the 380 GeV CLIC design are presented.

A. Antipov; N. Biancacci; X. Buffat; K.S.B. Li; CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; Three questions motivated this study for the CERN Large Hadron Collider in terms of beam stability: (i) why a chromaticity close to zero seemed more critical than predicted during Run 1 (in 2011 and 2012) and during Run 2 (in 2015)?; (ii) why some past simulations with a chromaticity close to zero revealed a more critical situation with the transverse damper than without?; (iii) what should be the minimum operational chromaticity in the future in the LHC and High-Luminosity LHC? A new Vlasov solver (called GALACTIC) was developed to shed light on the destabilising mechanism of the transverse damper; which is a potential contributor to explain the LHC observation. Due to the features; which are discussed in this paper; the name 'ISR (for Imaginary tune Split and Repulsion) instability' is suggested for this new kind of single-bunch instability with zero chromaticity.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpaf048_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpaf048.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpaf048_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAF048,

This requirement yields the need to further improve the longitudinal impedance model for the Proton Synchrotron (PS). In this impedance model it is necessary to include not only obvious impedance sources; such as RF cavities and kickers but also seemingly innocuous elements like certain vacuum components. Individually these vacuum elements would give only a small impedance contribution; however; due to the large number of these elements in the machine; their resultant combined impedances impact the overall impedance budget. This paper presents the electromagnetic simulation analysis of the PS sector gate valves along with EM measurements confirming the simulation model. These measurements are especially crucial in this case since no complete mechanical model or drawings are available and assumptions had to be made regarding its interior mechanical structure.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpaf051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpaf051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpaf051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAF051,

In the Proton Synchrotron (PS); a pre-injector of the LHC; these intensities can result in beam instabilities and potential RF heating of machine components; such that impedance mitigation measures are required. To study these intensity effects; the PS impedance model has been developed and is continuously updated. Each new machine element that is to be added into the accelerator requires an impedance study to minimize its contribution with respect to the machine's overall impedance budget. In such a context; this paper presents the impedance analysis of the new design of the internal beam dump for the PS; showing the design process required to reduce the impedance contribution of this element. Furthermore; the impedance analysis of the currently installed beam dump is analysed in order to compare the impedance contributions of the two designs.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpaf052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpaf052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpaf052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAF052,

The intensity should be doubled for HL-LHC and high losses may be a major performance limitation. Bunches extracted from the PS; the SPS injector; are produced in a 40 MHz RF system applying a bunch rotation at the end of the cycle and therefore cannot be perfectly matched to the 200 MHz SPS RF bucket. The possibility of using a lower harmonic additional RF capture system in the SPS was already proposed after the LEP era in preparation for transfer of the LHC beam but the bunch rotation was the preferred solution; since the induced voltage in the SPS 200 MHz RF system would be too large to ensure stability in a low harmonic system without mitigation measures. However; the use of the upgraded one-turn feedback and the 200 MHz RF system as a Landau cavity could help to improve stability. The feasibility of this scenario to reduce capture losses in the SPS is analysed and presented in this paper. The choice of an optimum RF frequency and voltage is also discussed. The transfer to the main 200 MHz is simulated using a realistic bunch distribution.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpaf053_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpaf053.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpaf053_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAF053,

After the detection of a quench; the quench heater power supplies will discharge currents of several hundreds of amperes into the quench heater strips glued to the coils; and the CLIQ units will discharge an oscillating current in the order of 1~kA directly into the coils. These currents can have a significant effect on the circulating beam if the discharge occurs before the beam is dumped. In the HL-LHC inner triplet quadrupole magnets and 11 T dipole magnets; which will be installed in the collimation region dispersion suppressor; this effect will even be stronger due to the larger number of quench heaters and use of CLIQ units (triplet magnets only) as well as due to the greater value of beta function in comparison with the present LHC.

The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) at CERN is the last accelerator in the injector chain of the LHC. One factor that is currently known to limit the intensity of the beam for injection to the LHC; is the longitudinal beam-coupling impedance in the SPS. One known source of multi-bunch instability is the vacuum flanges and campaigns to mechanically shield this source were completed in the year 2000. However; today it cannot be excluded that some of these shields may have partial or indeed full failures. Since these flanges are next to a QF magnet and are in most cases connected to a BPH (Beam Position Monitor Horizontal); it is possible to carry out via the BPH an in-situ measurement of the effectiveness of the shields. In this paper we present a methodology as well as measurement results taken with this non-intrusive in-situ method.

For example; synchrobetatron coupling may excite transverse resonances in the ring. We will use the Synergia code to simulate the effects of this synchrobetatron coupling on the iRCS design with nonlinear inserts. Our goal will be to identify new invariants in the presence of this coupling. Assuming the synchrotron tune is sufficiently small; we have identified one or more adiabatic invariants of the motion.

Sextupoles are useful and even necessary in circular accelerators for chromaticity corrections. They are routinely used in most rings; i.e. CESR. Although sextupole magnets are necessary for particle energy corrections; they also have undesirable effects on dynamic aperture; especially because of their non-linear coupling term in the momentum kick. Studies of integrable systems suggest that there is an analytic way to create transport lattices with specific transfer matrices that limit the momentum kick to one dimension. A one-dimension sextupole is needed for chromaticity corrections: a horizontal sextupole for horizontal bending magnets. We know how to make a ""composite"" horizontal sextupole using regular 2D sextupoles and linear transfer matrices in an ideal thin-lens approximation. Thus; one could create an accelerator lattice using linear elements; in series with sextupole magnets to create a '1d sextupole'.

These effects make some particles move on to a machine resonance and become unstable. Linear elements of beam optics cannot reduce the tune spread induced by SC because of its intrinsic nonlinear nature. We investigate the possibility to mitigate it by a thin McMillan lens providing a nonlinear axially symmetric kick; which is qualitatively opposite to the accumulated kick by SC. Experimentally; the proposed concept can be tested in Fermilab's IOTA ring. A thin McMillan lens can be implemented by a short (70 cm) insertion of an electron beam with specifically chosen density distribution in transverse directions. In this article; to see if McMillan lenses reduce the tune spread induced by SC; we make several simulations with particle tracking code Synergia. We choose such beam and lattice parameters that tune spread is roughly 0.5 and a beam instability due to the half-integer resonance 0.5 is observed. Then; we try to reduce emittance growth by shifting betatron tunes by adjusting quadrupoles and reducing the tune spread by McMillan lenses.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpaf071_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpaf071.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpaf071_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAF071,

Gillespie Associates; Inc.; Del Mar; California; USA; A Particle Beam Optics Laboratory (PBO Lab) module has been developed for the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) version of the TURTLE program commonly known as Graphic-Turtle. The PSI-TURTLE version extends the original TURTLE program by including several unique beam optics capabilities; as well as by providing a self-contained graphics package. The unique optics modeling; together with the data visualization enhancements; make the PSI-TURTLE program ideal for certain types of beam simulations. The PBO Lab environment provides a single graphic user interface (GUI) that features an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use drag-and-drop beamline construction kit. Underlying the GUI is a sophisticated object model developed specifically for the accelerator community. PBO Lab provides a common interface for multiple charged particle optics codes.

For decades; octupole magnets have been used as an established and well-understood passive mitigation method. Present and the future accelerator facilities; like FAIR or FCC; impose new challenges on the passive mitigation due to higher energies and smaller beam emittances. Lattice resonances usually restrict the tolerable tune-spreads which are essential for the passive mitigation methods. We study the stability of transverse bunch oscillations provided by octupole magnets and radio-frequency quadrupoles. The special focus of our study is on the interplay and role of decoherence; phase-mixing and Landau damping for the different mitigation schemes.

The linac could provide a number of positrons as high as 109/pulse in a 200 ns pulse but the number of positrons for PADME is limited below 105/pulse in order to keep the pile-up probability in the calorimeter low enough. The PADME experiment is indeed limited by the low duty factor (10e-5=200ns/20ms). An alternative proposal to use the DAΦNE positron ring as a linac pulse stretcher; by injecting each pulse into the ring and extracting it by a slow resonant extraction using the m/3 resonance; is described in this paper. This allows to distribute the positrons of a linac pulse in a much longer pulse (0.2 - 0.5 ms) increasing the duty factor up to ~ 2%. The required modifications of the DAΦNE positron transfer line and main ring are presented. A dedicate lattice for the ring has been designed and tracking of the positrons in the ring has been performed to optimize extraction parameters and give a preliminary estimate of the extracted beam characteristics.; * M.

The temporal pattern of the emitted bursts depends on given machine parameters; like momentum compaction factor; acceleration voltage; and damping time.

The fast temporal variation and small scale of these micro-structures put challenging demands on their observation.

To suppress the LCBI; we routinely operate a third harmonic cavity (HCV) in a passive mode. By properly tuning HCV; the instability is almost completely suppressed. Because of the lower beam energy (750 MeV) and brilliant beam emittance (17.5 nm-rad); the Touschek effect becomes severe in the UVSOR. To guarantee enough beam lifetime; we also apply HCV for lengthening the bunch. The suppression of the instability and increasing the beam lifetime are crucial benefits by HCV for the UVSOR. However; not only the origin of the LCBI but also the Landau damping effect by HCV has not been understood systematically yet. We have noticed that one of the HOMs at HCV itself could cause the LCBI and observed the behavior of the instability; which strongly depends on the beam current. From the experiment we have discussed the cause of the instability with the HOM theory.

Typical implementations model the dynamics of a charge density in a damped harmonic oscillator; with a small perturbation due to collective effects. This description imposes some limits to the applicability: Because after a certain simulation time coherent synchrotron motion will be damped down; effectively only the incoherent motion is described. Furthermore - even though computed - the tune spread is typically masked by the use of a charge density instead of individual particles. As a consequence; some effects are not reproduced. In this contribution; we present methods that allow to consider single-particle motion; coherent synchrotron oscillation; non-linearities of the accelerating voltage; higher orders of the momentum compaction factor; as well as modulations of the accelerating voltage.

Self-consistent macroparticle simulations using both distributions show similar structure in emittance growth but also extra instability stopbands. The emittance growth from the Waterbag distribution has larger stopband than that from the Gaussian distribution.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak040_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak040.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak040_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK040,

ipac2018,,THPAK046,The Ion-Hose Instability in High-Current Multi-Pulse Induction Linacs,LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; The ion-hose instability has long been considered a danger for long-pulse; high-current electron linear induction accelerators (LIAs)*. This instability is enabled by beam-electron ionization of residual background gas in the accelerator. The space-charge of the high-energy beam ejects low-energy electrons from the ionized channel; leaving a positively-charged ion channel that attracts the electron beam. The beam can oscillate in the potential well around the channel position. Likewise; the electron beam attracts the ions; which can oscillate about the beam position. Because of the vast differences in particle mass; the oscillations are out of phase; and the amplitudes grow unstably. The number of instability e-foldings is proportional to the channel ion density*; which in turn is proportional to the background pressure and pulse length. This scaling of the instability growth was demonstrated on the long-pulse DARHT-II linear induction accelerator (LIA) at Los Alamos**. The ion-hose instability is also problematic for high-current multi-pulse LIAs; because ion recombination times are so very long at typical background pressures. Moreover; because of low ion channel ion densities; and massive ions; channel expansion is too slow to reduce the instability growth by very much. In particular; the ion channel is expected to persist and its density to increase during the 3-microsecond duration of a four-pulse burst from the 2-kA; 20-MeV Scorpius LIA now being developed. Recent simulations with an experimentally validated code that was used to predict DARHT-II growth rates have shown that the magnetic focusing field designed for Scorpius will be strong enough to inhibit ion-hose instability if the background pressure is kept below a value that is readily attainable with the present designs of induction cells and other accelerator components.

The 800-MeV beam is transported through a beam line containing many bending and focusing elements before it reaches the pRad beam optics system where the beam spot size requirement is nominally 2 mm (RMS). Here we discuss the efforts to reconcile the beam transport inconsistencies (sizes) seen between comparisons of the beam sizes obtained using the LANL version of the beam envelope code TRANSPORT with those measured along the beam line. The transverse input beam parameters for the code were extracted from a fit to several wire-scanner measurements located in the downstream portion of the LINAC. The longitudinal input beam parameters were extrapolated from lower-energy information. Recently; new measurements were made of the beam line element locations and compared with legacy drawings. Beam envelope measurements made at various locations throughout the beam line using wire scanners and gated imaging systems were compared to the calculated results.

In case of crystals one obtains parametric X-ray radiation; its frequency is determined by distance between crystallographic planes and direction of electron beam. If instead of crystal one considers a periodic structure of metallic wires with period of the order of mm; one can expect emission of THz radiation. In the present contribution we consider theoretical approaches for modeling of the distribution of electromagnetic field from electron bunches in lattice formed by metallic wires. The analytical description is possible for the case of wires with small radius; the range of validity is checked by numerical simulations. The intensity of radiation will be significantly increased if the electrons in the bunch could radiate coherently.

ipac2018,,THPAK072,Generation of Flat Ultra-Low Emittance Beams,UCLA; Los Angeles; USA; PBPL; Los Angeles; USA; By placing a cathode in a longitudinal magnetic field generated by a solenoid or permanent magnet; angular-momentum dominated electron beams can be produced. Such beams can be uncoupled using a skew-quadrupole channel to remove the angular momentum and yield flat beams with an ultralow emittance in one of the transverse dimensions. Flat beams have immediate relevance in our pursuit of ultrahigh brightness in two dimensions for dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) or slab beam applications. We are currently investigating the possibility of implementing flat beam generation at the UCLA Pegasus beamline. We utilize particle tracking simulations to optimize the transverse emittance ratio and normalized transverse emittance. Our simulations show emittance ratios of more than 100 and normalized emittances in the <5 nm range in the vertical dimension; matching analytic estimates. In addition to simulation results; experimental plans to implement and test the flat beam transform (FBT) are also discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak072_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak072.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak072_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK072,

For this reason; in the commissioning phase; a molecular hydrogen ion (H2+) beam is often used as a model for the deuteron beam without the radiation risk. However; composite ions are susceptible to particle interactions that do not affect single ions; such as stripping of electrons and charge exchange. Such interactions affect the beam dynamics results; and may lead to production of secondary particles; which in high-intensity beams may cause damage to the accelerator and reduce the quality of the beam. In order to understand these effects; we have modified the IMPACT-T particle tracking code to include particle interactions during the tracking simulation through a high-intensity continuous-wave (CW) radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ). This code is also designed to be easily extensible to other interactions; such as collisions or break-up of heavier ions.

However; the long interaction lengths compared to the bunch length; numerical cancellation; and difficult 3D retardation conditions make accurate simulation of CSR effects notoriously difficult. To ease the computational burden; CSR codes often make severe simplifications such as an ultra-relativistic bunch travelling on a prescribed reference trajectory. Here we report on a new CSR model implemented in the General Particle Tracer (GPT) code that avoids most of the usual assumptions: It directly evaluates the Liénard'Wiechert potentials based on the stored history of the beam. It makes no assumptions about reference trajectories; and also takes into account the transverse size of the beam.

ipac2018,,THPAK103,Pragmatic Method of Deducing a Wake Function for a General 3D Structure,CERN; Geneva; Switzerland; SOLEIL; Gif-sur-Yvette; France; A key quantity in simulating collective beam instabilities is the wake potential of a bunch of particles whose charge distribution is continuously evolving in time. However; obtaining such wake potential is only possible if a wake excited by a single particle in the surrounding environment is known. A practical self-consistent approach was developed to obtain an effective wake function from a numerical wake potential computed for a finite length bunch. The wake potential is processed to a numerical impedance which is decomposed into a set of well-known analytical wake functions. The decomposed impedance is then transformed back into time domain and; thus; converted into an effective wake function which is by nature physical and most consistent with the numerical wake potential. Though the method is limited by the initial numerical impedance data and the choice of impedance decomposition; the retrieved wake function can be used in instability simulations with a bunch whose length is comparable to that used in the electromagnetic field solver. We show that the method can be applied to a general 3D structure; which allows finding effective wake functions of realistic vacuum chambers.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak103_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak103.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak103_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK103,

Since 2002; developments towards 300 μA total extraction became compelling because of the ISAC expansion. To meet future requirements (for addition of a new beam-line); a total extraction of 310 − 450 μA shall be envisioned. With such an increase of beam current; the space charge effect becomes a major concern in the centre region; as it limits the maximum amount of beam current achievable out of the machine. Therefore; numerical simulation on beam orbits with the space charge force has has been initiated; starting from the injection gap. This study is focused on the beam bunches which are very long compared with transverse size (because TRIUMF extraction is by stripping of H-minus and separated turns are not required). In order to achieve an improved understanding of the space charge effect; we worked to validate the simulations performed without and with the space charge force; using realistic centre region geometry. Our goal is to work out the space charge limits and their dependence upon the bunchers; rf voltage; and matching.

ipac2018,,THPAK129,"Modeling Challenges for Energy Recovery Linacs With Long, High Charge Bunches",JLab; Newport News; Virginia; USA; Historically; nearly all energy recovery linacs (ERLs) built and operated were used to drive a free-electron laser (FEL). The requirement for high peak current bunches necessitates bunch compression and handling the attendant beam dynamical challenges. In recent years; ERLs have turned from being drivers of light sources toward applications for nuclear physics experiments; Compton backscattering sources and strong electron cooling. Unlike an FEL; these latter uses require long; high charge bunches with small energy spread. The electron bunch must maintain a small projected energy spread and therefore must avoid gross distortion due to CSR and longitudinal space charge over a single (or multiple) recirculations. Accurately modeling the relevant collective effects in the system 'space charge; microbunching instability; CSR and the effect of shielding' in addition to beam dynamical processes such as halo; presents a formidable challenge. Absent a code that models all of these effects; we outline an approach towards the design; analysis and optimization of the high-energy electron cooler for the Jefferson Lab Electron-Ion Collider and survey widely used codes and their capabilities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak129_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak129.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak129_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK129,

We investigate compression of two-bunch train via velocity bunching scheme in a traveling wave accelerator (TWA) tube by varying the phase of TWA tube in a very large range. Beam dynamics simulations show that when the phase injected into the accelerator tube for the beam is set to ≪-100 degree; velocity bunching occurs in a deep over-compression mode; where two-bunch train is continuously tunable in time and in energy space; and the emittance of each sub-bunch is also preserved. In the experiment; we use energy spectrum and defecting cavity to diagnose the train's energy space and time space respectively; the measurements demonstrated that two-bunch train through deep over-compression scheme is separated both in time and in energy space; which also agree well with the predictions.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak131_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak131.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak131_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK131,

The proposed approach is different from the usual presentations of non-linear equations in the form of Taylor series. In the paper; we use the coefficients representation in the form of two-dimensional matrices. The similar approach allows us not only to significantly reduce the time spent on modeling beam dynamics but use symbolic mathematics to calculate the necessary two-dimensional matrices. This method demonstrates the effectiveness when solving problems of dynamics problems and optimization of control systems; and for evaluating the influence of various effects on the dynamics of the beam (including taking into account the spin). Using the tools of symbolic computations not only significantly increases the computational efficiency of the method; but also allows you to create databases of ""ready-made"" transformations (Lego-objects); which greatly simplify the process of modeling particle dynamics.

Multi-stage bunch compression schemes have been identified as a possible source of such an instability. The dispersive sections in these compressors translate energy inhomogeneities within the bunch into longitudinal charge density inhomogeneities. In conjunction with a collective force driving locally density-dependent energy modulations this leads to intricate longitudinal beam dynamics. As a consequence of the thin shape those bunches form in the longitudinal phase space; efficient simulation of such systems is not straight forward. At high resolutions; the numerical representation of the phase space density on a uniform grid is too wasteful; due to the large unpopulated phase space regions. In this contribution we present advances made in the development of a simulation code that addresses the problem of sparsely populated phase spaces by means of quadtree domain decomposition. A focus lies on the explanation of the underlying tree data structure.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpak138_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpak138.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpak138_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAK138,

Using non-linear correctors; the dynamic aperture was increased to acceptable levels; however; the difficulty to have an accurate magnetic model of the magnets required for this correction motivates the development of alternative methods.

Recent studies have shown a large increase in the maximum sustained RF surface electric fields in copper structures operating at cryogenic temperatures. These novel approaches allow significant performance improvements of RF photoinjectors. Indeed the operation at high surface fields results in considerable increase of electron beam brilliance. This increased brilliance requires high field quality in the RF photoinjector and specifically in its power coupler. In this work we present a novel power coupler for the RF photoinjector. The coupler is a compact X-band TM01 mode launcher with a fourfold symmetry which minimized both the dipole and the quadrupole RF components. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal009_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal009.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal009_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL009,

A well-established technique is the so called Darmstadt Soft Chemical Polishing; which consists of an ultrasonic cleaning of the cavity with ultrapure water followed by oxidizing the inner surface with nitric acid. After rinsing with water the niobium oxide layer is removed with hydrofluoric acid in a separate second step. Finally the structure is rinsed and then dried by a nitrogen flow. Until now each cavity in operation was chemically treated with a proven record of success. In order to understand and to optimize the process on the niobium surface; systematic tests with samples were performed and analyzed using material science techniques like SEM; SIMS and EDX.

Bunch-By-Bunch (BBB) feedback has been needed to suppress coupled-bunch mode instabilities (CBMIs); and the feedback has this far been provided in all three planes by a single stripline kicker. This is done by combining the horizontal and vertical baseband feedback signals with the longitudinal feedback signal that is upconverted to the 150 MHz - 250 MHz range.

Besides; the cross section of the beam duct must be kept smooth for lowering the impedance. The aluminum extruded beam duct of 10 mm inside and 1 ~ 2 m in length was developed for this purpose. The beam duct was machined in ethanol to obtain a clean surface for a lower thermal outgassing rate. To mitigate the impedance of the flange connection; a special designed diamond-edge gasket and the aluminum flange without knife edge were developed. The inner diameters of both flange and gasket; 10 mm; are the same as that of beam duct. The sealing of the gasket has been proved leak-tight.

Recent studies on the vacuum RF breakdown at high electric fields suggest that the temperature in the cavity surface during the high power RF pulse has a significant effect on the behavior of the breakdown rate. In order to investigate the breakdown property of the cryogenic cavity aiming at a very high accelerating field with as low breakdown rate as possible; one-dimensional simulations of the temperature rise in the cavity surface have been done for various combinations of the RF pulse width and the peak input RF power.

However; their use in dust-sensitive areas - such as superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities - has always been limited by concerns about accidental dust emission; which could induce detrimental field emission. As future machines will necessarily rely on highly-efficient SRF cavities; able to supply very high accelerating gradients; requirements in terms of particle release from vacuum components (e.g.; pumps and valves) are becoming more and more stringent. At the same time; achieving stable ultra-high vacuum conditions is crucial; as condensed residual gas might also be a potential source of field emission. At present; a unified standard procedure to assess dust generation and propagation along a machine is still missing and discussions are ongoing in the vacuum community. Recent experimental measurements demonstrated the compatibility of sintered NEG pumps with ultra-clean environments; due to their intrinsic very low dust release. In parallel; in-situ tests performed at different accelerator facilities showed absence of dust contamination from NEGs and no impact on cavities efficiency.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal076_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal076.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal076_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL076,

While much of the recent R&D focus has been on materials and surface science; our aim is to optimize the cavity geometry to maximize performance with current materials. The recent demonstration of a highly efficient parallel-feed NCRF structure at SLAC has served as a proof-of-concept. Applied to SRF; such a structure could dramatically reduce power consumption while boosting the achievable gradient. Instead of coupled elliptical cells; our structure employs isolated reentrant cells. To feed RF power to the cavities; each cell is directly coupled to an integrated manifold. The structure is made in two parts; split along the beam axis; which are then joined. Such a structure has been fabricated from bulk Cu and tested at SLAC - designed for X-band; it operates at a record gradient of 150 MV/m. Adapting to SRF at 1.3 GHz and fabricating from Nb; such a cavity could achieve more than 50% lower RF loss and 40% higher gradient compared to the TESLA cavity. We will describe our simulations and propose an experimental roadmap for demonstrating this technology.,"Funding: This work is supported by the Department of Energy, Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, under contract DE-AC02-76SF00515.",reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal080_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal080.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal080_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL080,

Semiconductor switches using SIC-MOSFETs are expected to replace the thyratron; and they are composed of circuits in which many semiconductor switches are multiplexed in series and parallel for high power. Semiconductor switches using SIC-MOSFETs are expected to replace the thyratron; and they are also designed by connecting many semiconductor switches in parallel-series. To realize a low switching noise; it is common to form a symmetrical circuit. However; as the number of parallel connections increases; the circuit length between input and output becomes longer; so the output waveform is distorted due to any timing jitter or level fluctuation. Therefore; we propose a radially symmetric type of a module switch which does not cause level fluctuation due to the timing jitter by equalizing the circuit length independently of the number of semiconductor switches. The design and preliminary test results of two types of switch circuits; radially symmetric type and line symmetric type are presented here.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal082_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal082.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal082_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL082,

We have previously demonstrated that quaternary Ti-Zr-Hf-V coating deposited from an alloy wire has the lowest desorption yields; the highest sticking probability and sorption capacity. In this work; we explore the single element targets which are widely available and can be produced in a form of a wire that is easy to apply for a uniform coating of various shapes of vacuum chamber. Single metal Zr coatings have been tested to find a more efficient and cheaper way of producing the NEG-coated vacuum chambers. Two samples coated with Zr of dense and columnar structure were analysed and results of the pumping properties are reported. The results show that pure Zr coating could be an economic solution; despite not being as effective as can be achieved with quaternary NEG film. It shows that columnar Zr coating can be activated and reaches full pumping capacity at 160°C.

With total accumu-lated beam dose near to 690 A.h and three orders of mag-nitude reduction of outgassing the design goal of 500 mA beam current and electron energy of 1.5 GeV has been achieved. As the beam current was increased, a few vacu-um problems were encountered, including vacuum leaks in RF and arc sectors and unexpected pressure bursts near photon absorbers.

They are in operation since 2015. For control of their respective working points; knowledge about cavity voltage and higher order mode (HOM) frequency spec-trum is mandatory. After their installation in the storage ring and connection of the RF feeder to a high power isolator and a transmitter; the influence of the external elements on the quality factor and the HOM spectrum should be verified with respect to simulations of a simpli-fied model of a stand-alone cavity.

The CANREB project will deliver a high resolution spectrometer (HRS) for beam purification; and a charge breeding system consisting of a radiofrequency quadrupole (RFQ) beam cooler and buncher; an electron beam ion source (EBIS); and a Nier-type spectrometer to prepare the beam for post-acceleration. Bunching the beam prior to charge breeding will significantly enhance the efficiency of the EBIS. The RFQ buncher will accept continuous §I{60}{keV} rare isotope beams from the ARIEL or ISAC production targets and efficiently deliver low emittance bunched beams. A pulsed drift tube (PDT) will adjust the energy of the bunched beam for injection into the EBIS to match the acceptance of the post-accelerating RFQ. Ion optical simulations were carried out to inform the design of the RFQ buncher and PDT. Simulations indicate that delivery of up to 107~ions per bunch with high efficiency is possible.

Enhancing the surface properties of the superconducting material in the range of the penetration depth is also beneficial. One direction of search for new materials with better properties is the modification of bulk niobium by nitrogen doping. In the Nb-N phase diagram the cubic delta-phase of NbN has the highest critical temperature (16 K).

The vertical test performance of the C75 cavities was preserved in the cryomodule with one of the cavities achieving the performance specification of an accelerating gradient of 19 MV/m with a quality factor of ~8×109 at 2.07 K. The performance in terms of microphonics and tuner operation was similar to that of original CEBAF cavities; as expected; and the high-order modes are properly damped. The quality factor of the two C75 cavities was the highest achieved in a CEBAF cryomodule; possibly due to the better magnetic flux expulsion of ingot Nb than standard fine-grain Nb.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal134_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal134.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal134_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL134,

The cryomodules for this project each consist of eight 1.3-GHz cavities produced by two vendors; Research Instruments GmbH in Germany (RI*) and Ettore Zanon S.p.a. in Italy (EZ*); using niobium cell material from Tokyo Denkai Co.; Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co.; Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). During the initial production run; cavity performance from one of the vendors (Vendor A) was far below expectation. All the cavities had low Q0; later attributed to minimal EP as well as high-flux-trapping NX material; early quench behaviour below 18 MV/m; with many having Q0 roll-off at 12-16 MV/m. Production was stopped multiple times over the following 6 months; with test batches of cavities being made to ascertain the root cause of the problem. The final root cause of the problem was found to be inappropriate grinding of the RF surface prior to welding which left normal conducting inclusions in the surface. In addition; most cavities showed internal and external weld spatter which required post weld grinding and a very rough surface from operating the electropolishing machine in an etching rather than polishing regime. All issues have been corrected on new cavities and rework is underway on the originally effected cavities.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpal140_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpal140.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpal140_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPAL140,

Undulator tapering techniques can be used to improve the conversion efficiency by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However at present there are no robust tapered undulator x-FEL schemes operating at 10% efficiency. In this paper we report on the development of tapered radiofrequency (RF) undulator. An RF undulator is a microwave waveguide in which strong RF field is excited that interacts with a charged particle beam forcing it to radiate coherent x-rays while undergoing a wiggling motion. RF undulators are attractive for use in x-FELs due to their large beam aperture and a short undulator period. Strongly tapered RF undulators (with tapering of a wavelength) due to non-resonant trapping regime allow keeping high overall XFEL efficiency being driven by laser plasma accelerated beams usually having high enough current but large energy spread (1-10%).,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmf012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmf012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmf012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMF012,

Therefore a full characterisation of the behaviour of the stripline kicker under conditions as close as possible to the expected working conditions will be very valuable. To that end the CLIC stripline has been installed in the ALBA Synchrotron Light Source and has been characterised with beam. Prior to its installation; the effect of the stripline kicker on the machine impedance has been assessed. The installation has required the design of an absorber to screen the stripline from synchrotron radiation and additional BPMs have been installed for a better kick angle determination. The commissioning of the stripline with beam has been performed following closely beam parameters; pressure and temperature. The studies with beam include the determination of the longitudinal and transverse impedance of the kicker*; the field homogeneity when excited with a dc field and the field ripple when pulsed. This contribution reports on the first experience with the stripline kicker for the CLIC DR in the ALBA storage ring and presents the results of the initial beam characterisation.; * M.

To increase the gamma-ray flux the energy of the infrared laser pulses are planned to be amplified within the interaction region using a resonant cavity. This passive amplifier composed of a Fabry-Perot cavity will allow the laser pulse bunches to coherently and constructively stack.

One of the key challenges is a low emittance preservation of electron beam because the vertical emittance of 20 mm.mrad or less should be transported to the main ring without a damping ring. For this purpose; the fine alignment of accelerator components is a crucial issue since the linac alignment was badly damaged by the big earthquake in 2011. From the simulation results of emittance growth; the alignment of the quadrupole magnets and accelerating structures should be conducted at the level of 300 um in rms along the 600-m-long linac. In addition; we are aiming at the level of 100 um alignment in rms within the short range distance of 100 m long. Even after the fine component alignment can be achieved; the fine beam orbit manipulation is necessary for low emittance preservation. For these reasons; we have developed the new BPM readout system based on VME64x. The new system has improved the precision of beam position measurement up to 3 um from 25 um. We will describe the software development of the new BPM readout system.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmf045_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmf045.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmf045_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMF045,

TA is using the fluorescence detectors (FD) for observation the air fluorescence(AFY) which are emitted in the cascade generated by an UHECR in atmosphere. One of the important observables is primary energy of UHECR; however it has 21% systematic uncertainty. For reduction of the uncertainty; we have been operated an 40-MeV electron linear accelerator from 2010 which we have constructed for absolute energy calibration. The accelerator is located at 100 m from FD station; and can shot electron beam which the direction is vertical into the air; the energy is 40-MeV; the pulse width is 1 micro-second; and the beam charge is 160 pC. The AFY efficiency and FD calibration parameters can be calibrated; which means energy scale of UHECR; by observation of the AFY which are generated by the electron beam in the air. The most important beam parameter is beam charge. The requirement of the accuracy of charge measurement is a few %; then we have developed the double faraday cups and one current transfer system. We calibrated the current transfer by the double faraday cups; and we could achieve about 1% accuracy.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmf046_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmf046.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmf046_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMF046,

Adjustment of the optics and occasionally the rf phases is required each time the bunch charge is changed. Presently; these adjustments are done by the operator during each experiment. This is time consuming and inefficient; more so at high charge and for complex experimental set ups. In an attempt to reduce the amount of time spent adjusting parameters by hand; several optimization methods in simulation are being explored. This includes using the well-known Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II); incorporated into OPAL-T. We have also investigated a model-based method and novel structure based algorithms developed at ANL. Ongoing efforts include using these optimization methods to improve operations at the AWA. Simulation results will be compared to measured beam parameters at the AWA; and one optimization method will be selected for use in guiding operations going forward.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmf049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmf049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmf049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMF049,

It consists of two undulator sections placed inside optical cavity. The first section is a conventional uniform undulator and the second one is a tapered undulator. At start time point X-ray radiation is mostly produced by the uniform section. Mirrors of XFELO's optical resonator are designed so that diffraction Q-factor reaches the highest value; i.e losses are near zero. As X-ray power increases the tapered undulator begins to contribute more to radiation power. However a portion of that power misses mirrors of the optical cavity; because those are tuned to confine radiation produced by the first undulator. This process establishes a steady state operation of the XFELO.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmf050_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmf050.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmf050_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMF050,

However; a full charge injector is neces- sary for this scheme and its design can be nontrivial; in par- ticular to satisfy the large single bunch charge requirements in special lling patterns for timing experiments. In the High Energy Photon Source; we propose using the booster also as a high energy accumulator ring to recapture the spent bunches extracted from the storage ring; so as to relax the challenges in generation and acceleration of bunches with a high charge; and as a cost-e ective solution compared to building a dedicated full energy accumulator ring.

Since the dynamic aperture (DA) and the beam performance become sensitive against errors due to the strong quadrupoles and sextupoles; we carried out tracking simulations to evaluate the tolerance of machine imperfections such as the misalignment; magnetic field errors; the BPM offset; etc. It is found that the first-turn-steering (FTS) with the use of single-pass BPM's is indispensable because even under strict (but attainable) tolerances the beam cannot be stored without steering kicks. We then confirmed that after the FTS a sufficiently large DA can be obtained for accumulating the beam by the off-axis injection. By performing the orbit and optics corrections for the stored beam; we can finally achieve an emittance value of 160 ~ 180 pm.rad; being close to the design value. We also found that a naive application of the SVD algorithm to orbit corrections yields unwanted local bumps between BPM's and this deteriorates the vertical emittance.

This will become crucial especially in future light sources where narrow gap in-vacuum IDs are normally used. While the Touschek scattered electron begins to oscillate in the horizontal direction with the amplitude proportional to the dispersion at the scattering point and to the momentum deviation after scattering; the motion is converted into the vertical direction due to the betatron coupling and some of the scattered electrons are lost at the narrow gaps of in-vacuum IDs. The momentum deviation by the Touschek scattering reaches 5% more; and according to which the vertical oscillation is more excited. Hence electrons even scattered at small horizontal dispersion are also lost at narrow gap IDs. We carried out computer simulations by taking the present SPring-8 storage ring and a planned 3GeV low-emittance ring as examples.

Some of key features are permanent dipole magnets; SUS vacuum chambers; highly accurate and reliable electron and photon beam position monitors; and an extremely small emittance beam injection from the SACLA linac to the storage ring. In the process of the optimization; we cannot rely merely on independent developments; the high packing factor lattice naturally imposes an integration of the individual efforts into a whole design. Thus; a test-half cell has been constructed as one of important milestones; where we need to carefully look through specification balances between different components; physical and magnetic interferences; etc. The presentation will give overall status on the developments as well as the test half-cell construction.; * H.

In particular SRF cavities of injector linacs using high accelerating gradients on low beta electron beams can affect the beam quality significantly when not aligned perfectly. On the other hand knowing the exact position of every cavity after several cool-down cycles of a cryomodule can be difficult depending on the cryomodule design. We will report on operational experience on the SC injector of the Darmstadt superconducting linac and ERL (S-DALINAC) showing unexpected effects on beam dynamics and beam quality. Operators could observe transverse beam deflections by changing accelerating phases of the injector SRF-cavities while a growth of tranverse emittance occurred at the same time. As beam currents in the S-DALINAC injector do never exceed 100 μA and the effects could even be observed at nA beam currents space-charge effects could be eliminated to be the reason for these observations.

This leads to the injection scheme without using a bump orbit and stable supply of the synchrotron radiation. In Aichi-SR we have performed usual injection scheme with 4 kicker magnets and making the bump. Because the circumference of the Aichi-SR is only 72 m; 3 beam lines are inside the bump. The Aichi-SR has performed top-up operation since its public open; so it is a crucial subject to eliminate the disturbance of the synchrotron radiation during the injection. We have installed the PSM in 2015 and developed the beam study continuously. At present; however; a perturbation to the stored beam by the PSM still has been observed and is not acceptable. We have performed beam diagnostic experiment and concluded that an additional dipole kick affects the beam. From the magnetic field measurement data; we have discussed the source of the additional kick; most likely is an eddy current on the Ti coating inside the ceramics duct of the PSM.

Different non-linear effects; in particular; residual octupole components of the magnetic field of the CATACT wiggler at high field level (2.5 T); proximity of the working point to a vertical sextupole resonance Qy=8/3 and weak coupling octupole resonance 2Qx+2Qy=19; high chromaticity; etc. decrease the beam life time. This is because of the reduced dynamic aperture and momentum acceptance for off-momentum particles. A new operation point at high vertical tune Qy=2.81 was tested. For this; injection and ramping tables have been modified. First the values were optimized by simulations; then during beam tests; to minimize betatron tune shaking during beam-energy ramps. It stabilized high-current beams by the fast-feedback system the whole process: injection at 0.5 GeV; ramping; and operation at 1.3 GeV cycles. It essentially improved life time and beam current. In addition; new low-alpha tables have been created and tested; resulting in the reduction of the momentum compaction factor to 10-4.

Combination of a compact storage ring and a laser wake-field accelerator (LWFA) might be the basis for future compact light sources and advancing user facilities. Meanwhile the post-LWFA beam is not fitted for storage and accumulation in conventional storage rings. New generation rings with adapted features are required. Different geometries and lattices of a ring operating between 50 to 500 MeV energy range were investigated. The model suitable to store the post-LWFA beam with a wide momentum spread (1% to 2%) and ultra-short electron bunches of fs range was chosen as basis for further detailed studies. The DBA-FDF lattice with relaxed settings; split elements and high order optics of tolerable strength allows improving the dynamic aperture up to 20 mm. The momentum acceptance of the compact lattice exceeds 8% while dispersion is limited.

With our experiment; we can measure the Raman spectrum at ultra-low frequencies. The measurement principle; which was recently published; is based on coherent nonlinear excitation of the observed sample. The spectrometer consists of a stretcher and an interferometer; which can be simply built from standard optics. We will show that the accessible spectral range overlaps well with that from the THz pulses of the planned FLUTE experiment.

The natural emittance of the ring is 3.4 nm at 500 MeV beam energy and the ring circumference is about 59 m. The resulting maximum gamma-ray photon energy is about 4 MeV by interacting with ~1 um laser. Due to the large energy loss associated with the gamma-ray photon emission; the electron beam dynamics are greatly affected. We have simulated the whole physics process including Compton scattering; radiation damping and quantum excitation and find that the equilibrium energy spread may be increased by one orders of magnitude depending on the laser parameters.

The SXL project requires a higher repetition rate and since improved beam quality compared to what the current photo-cathode gun can operate at is needed; a new photo-cathode gun will be manufactured. We briefly describe the components of the pre-injector; followed by the design of the new photo-cathode gun. The design is similar to the old gun but with a new RF cavity using elliptical irises and racetrack profile main cell. The current parameters for the next gun to be manufactured are discussed; and some simulations and expected beam quality from the injector are shown.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmk002_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmk002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmk002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMK002,

At many rings this is commonly achieved by operating fill patterns with gaps of sufficient length; but this is not favorable for rings that operate with passive harmonic cavities to damp instabilities and increase Touschek lifetime by lengthening the bunches. For such rings; gaps in the fill pattern could severely reduce the achievable bunch lengths. For the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring; sufficient bunch lengthening is also essential for conserving the ultralow emittance and reducing heat load on vacuum components at high current. It is therefore of interest to study methods to serve timing users while operating without gap in the fill pattern. Once such method is PPRE; where the transverse emittance of one bunch in the bunch train is increased by an incoherent betatron excitation. This paper presents simulations for the MAX IV 3 GeV storage ring and discusses the machine requirements as well as the achievable performance for timing users.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmk004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmk004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmk004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMK004,

The asymmetric multi-pole field contributes to the transverse emittance growth and degrades the beam quality. In order to overcome the problem; we propose a novel rotationally symmetric 1.6 cell RF gun to construct the symmetric field in this paper. The concrete proposal is that a coaxial cell with a symmetrical distribution of four grooves is concatenated to the first 0.6 cell at the photocathode end to form a new resonant cell (NRC) to mantain the symmetric multi-pole field in 1.6 cell. Our simulations indicate that 3D multi-pole fields of NRC are with the perfect symmetry. After that; the profile of the RF gun is optimized to improve the shunt impedance and mode separation and make the surface peak electric field at the photocathode end.

The velocity bunching is a technique that is commonly used to make the bunch length shorter at lower energies. However; since one velocity bunching has a correlation between bunch energy and length; we may not have so much room to change energies to obtain different coherent radiation wavelengths. Hence we propose a combination of velocity bunchings; that relaxes the restrictive correlation. We have three 4m traveling-wave accelerator tubes at LEBRA; Nihon U. The undulator is installed after the acceleration tubes and 2 x 45 degree bending magnets. Since the design of current undulator requires less than 25 MeV beam energy to obtain the radiation at THz region; the velocity bunching is reasonable for coherent radiation.

By varying the phase shifter gap; the FEL intensity measured at the QBPM oscillates and sine curve fitting can be applied to it for optimizing the FEL intensity. However; the optimal gap determined from fitting result is slightly different from the gap at which the maximum intensity is measured because distorted shapes are appeared from some phase shifters.

Combining these advancements with the large boosting in computing speed provides large flexibility and motivation to investigate new accelerator geometries. In this paper; we describe a new optimization approach for the geometry of accelerating cells. This approach uses a set of control points with variable positions to control a non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS); which describes the cavity shape. The positions of the control points are then optimized using differential-evolution optimization to maximize/minimize a defined optimization function; which is defined by the user and depends on the cavity parameters such as the shunt impedance; wall losses; peak surface fields…etc. This optimization approach leads to accelerator geometries with enhanced performance and very smooth surface fields.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmk049_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmk049.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmk049_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMK049,

The implementation is to insert a series of magnetic chicanes to introduce a path-length delay of the electron beam to the radiation beam. By correlating the electron slices of neighboring cooperation distances this can lengthen the collective interaction and thus enhance the spectral brightness. In the existing literature most studies rely on numerical simulations and there is limited work on analytical analysis. In this paper we formulate the problem of slippage enhanced SASE (SeSASE) high-gain FEL with inclusion of by-pass magnetic chicanes. The analysis takes the finite energy spread of the electron beam and the nonzero momentum compaction of the chicane into consideration. The evolution of spectral bandwidth of SeSASE is compared with that of usual SASE in theory and numerical simulations. The effects of finite beam energy spread and non-isochronisity are also quantified.; *J. Wu et al.; FEL2012 **B. W. J.

Recently there is a great interest in pursuing higher peak power (for example; at terawatt level) in FEL that can enable coherent diffraction imaging and probe fundamental high-field physics. The FEL radiation power can be increased by virtue of undulator tapering. However the FEL sideband signal begins to exponentially grow in the post-saturation regime. In this paper we extend our sideband analysis* by including both the energy detune due to discrete undulator tapering and longitudinal space charge in an effective 1-D model. A dispersion relation with explicit energy detune and space charge is derived. The study is carried out semi-analytically and compared with simulations.

For a high-gain tapered FEL; although the power is enhanced after the first saturation; it is known that there is a so-called second saturation point where the FEL power growth stops. In addition to the sideband instability; lack of transverse radiation focusing in the post-saturation regime can be another major reason leading to occurrence of the second saturation.

This would extend attosecond science to probe ultrafast dynamics with even finer resolution. To do so requires breaking below a characteristic FEL timescale of typically a few hundred optical cycles; dictated by the relative slippage of the radiation and electrons during amplification.

However such techniques would produce a train of closely separated pulses; while an isolated pulse would be preferable for some types of experiment.

This is measureable as the mean longitudinal and transverse energy spreads in the photoemitted electrons. ASTeC's Transverse Energy Spread Spectrometer (TESS)* experimental facility can be used with III-V semiconductor; multi-alkali and metal photocathodes to measure transverse and longitudinal energy distributions. Our R&D facilities also include in-vacuum quantum efficiency measurement; XPS; STM; plus ex-vacuum optical and STM microscopy for surface metrology. Intrinsic emittance is strongly affected by the photocathode surface roughness**; and the development of techniques to manufacture the smoothest photocathode is a priority for the electron source community.

Recently the CLARA injector has been commissioned with acceleration of beam to 50 MeV. For several years a normal conducting 2.5 cell S-band cavity RF gun operated at up to 80 MV/m has been used as the electron source for both VELA and CLARA. For further beam acceleration an S-band travelling wave 2m long cavity has been used. The gun has used several different copper cathodes throughout its operational life; employing different preparation techniques. Oxygen plasma treatment is a well-known procedure for removing hydrocarbon contamination from surfaces whereas Argon plasma treatment also removes contaminants and typically leaves a thinner oxide at the surface.

ipac2018,,THPMK097,First Conceptual Design Studies of an Electron Source for Ultrafast Electron Diffraction at DELTA,D. Krieg; S. Khan; DELTA; Dortmund; Germany; Universität Duisburg-Essen; Duisburg; Germany; Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a technique to study the structural dynamics of matter; combining diffraction of electrons with sub-angstrom De-Broglie wavelength with femtosecond time resolution. The method is complementary to X-ray scattering at free-electron lasers. UED pump-probe experiments require ultrashort laser pulses to pump a sample; electron bunches with small emittance and ultrashort length to analyze the state of the sample by diffraction; as well as excellent control of the delay between them. While most UED systems are based on electrostatic electron sources in the keV regime; electrons accelerated to a few MeV in a radiofrequency photocathode gun offer significant advantages regarding emittance and bunch length due to the reduction of space charge effects. Furthermore; the longer mean free path of MeV electrons allows for thicker samples and hence a broader range of possible materials. In this paper; a first conceptual design and simulation results for a university-based UED facility with ultrashort and low-emittance MeV electron bunches are presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpmk097_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpmk097.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpmk097_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPMK097,

We found that the NEA activation ability of atomic oxygen is almost a half of that of O2 molecule.*; *L. Guo; M. Kuriki; H. Iijima; K. Uchida.

In addition to reported quantum efficiencies of up to 70%; GaN needs to satisfy the demands for long lifetime; low dark current and low thermal emittance. In this contribution; the ongoing activities of the synthesis by means of reactive rf magnetron sputtering and characterization of GaN is presented.

The dominant radiation of HALS will be located in the VUV and soft X-ray region; which will be complementary with that of SSRF and HEPS. Except for high brilliance; high transverse coherence will be another signature feature of HALS. To achieve these goals; a multi-bend achromat based diffraction-limited storage ring was adopted as the main body of HALS. The general description and preliminary design of HALS will be briefly presented in this paper.

The RF modes generated inside the induction cells can deflect or degrade subsequent beam traversing the cell. Significant effort has been invested in minimizing the effect over several decades. One mechanism that is known to reduce the transverse impedance; the main observable experimentally which directly relates to the BBU amplitude; is to introduce ferrites to absorb the fields.

Polarized beams are essential to these studies; understanding of the hadron structure cannot be achieved without knowledge of the spin. The existing EIC concepts utilize both polarized electrons and polarized protons/light ion species to probe the sea quark and gluon distributions. Polarized deuterons provide an especially unique system for study by essentially providing a combination of quark and nuclear physics. We note that there are currently no operational polarized deuteron beam sources in the United States.

For the experiment; the PBG structure will be excited by a high charge (up to 10 nC) electron bunch; and a second smaller charge witness bunch will be accelerated. Because the PBG structure was fabricated with electroforming; the AWA beamline includes a Be window placed before the PBG structure that protects the cathode from contamination due to possible outgassing from the electroformed copper. The diameter of the Be window is 9 mm and the beam tube diameter of the PBG structure is 6.4 mm. The size of the high charge electron beam on Be window has to be minimized to minimize scattering. The parameters of the beamline had to be adjusted to achieve good propagation of the beam. An OPAL simulation for the AWA beamline was performed for 1; 5; and 10 nC beams. The beam size was experimentally measured at different positions in the beamline for different charges to verify simulations.

In parallel; the spectacular development of laser plasma acceleration (LPA) with several GeV beam acceleration in an extremely short distance appears very promising. As a first step; the qualification of the LPA with a FEL application sets a first challenge. Still; energy spread and beam divergence do not meet the state-of-the-art performance of the conventional accelerators and have to be manipulated to fulfill the FEL requirement. We report here on the undulator spontaneous emission measured after a transport manipulation electron beam line; using variable permanent magnet quadrupoles of variable strength for emittance handing and a demixing chicane equipped with a slit for the energy spread. Strategies of control electron beam position and dispersion have been elaborated. The measured undulator radiation provides an insight on the electron beam properties.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpml033_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpml033.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpml033_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPML033,

Due to the difficulties of non-linear optimization in targeting lower emittance values; a decision was made to symmetrize totally the ring with 20 identical cells having long free straight sections longer than 4 m. A 7BA solution elaborated by adopting the sextupole paring scheme with dispersion bumps originally developed at the ESRF-EBS; including reverse-bends; enabling an emittance of 72 pm.rad has been defined as the baseline lattice.

Dual-grating structures are one of the candidates for DLAs. They can be mass-produced using available nanofabrication techniques due to their simpler structural geometry compared to other types of DLAs. Apart from the results from optimization studies that indicate the best structures; this contribution also introduces two new schemes that can help further improve the accelerating efficiency in dual-grating structures.

C. Sharma; DELTECH; New Delhi; India; D.N. Gupta; M. Kaurpresenter; University of Delhi; Delhi; India; It has been revealed that a relativistic plasma wave; having an extremely large electric field; may be utilized for the acceleration of plasma particles. The large accelerating field gradient driven by a plasma wave is the basic motivation behind the acceleration mechanism. Such a plasma wave can be excited by a single laser in the form wakefield in laser-plasma interactions. In this paper; we study the enhancement of electron acceleration by plasma wave in presence of a laser* propagated perpendicular to the propagation of the wake wave. Electrons trapped in the plasma wave are effectively accelerated by the additional field of the laser combined with wakefield. The additional resonance provided by the laser field contributes to the large energy gain of electrons during acceleration. The resonant enhancement of electron acceleration has been validated by single particle simulations**. The dependence of energy gain on laser intensity; laser spot size; initial electron energy; and electron trajectories have been investigated.; * G. D. Tsakiris; C. Gahn; and V. K. Tripathi; Phys.

With regard to the evaluation of longitudinal phase oscillations during the transient injection process; bunch-by-bunch phase measurement is a useful tool for studying the behavior of the refilled bunches. A new upgraded beam phase monitor system with 1.2GHz bandwidth PXI waveform digitizer has been developed at Shanghai synchrotron radiation source (SSRF). Bunch-by-bunch phase information; retrieved from button pickup signals; is calculated by the zero-crossing detection method with the best phase resolution of 0.4ps. The refilled bunches can be separated from the stored ones; and the longitudinal offset of each refilled bunch has been measured. Several groups of experiments have been performed to verify the repeatability of bunch-by-bunch phase measurement; and some results regarding refilled bunches will be discussed in this paper.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpml068_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpml068.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpml068_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPML068,

The real beam size is a function of the image size of the CCD camera and point spread function (PSF) of the system. The performance of the measurement of the transverse electron beam size is given by the width of the PSF of X-ray pinhole camera. The contributions to the PSF width are the PSF of pinhole itself due to diffraction; and the PSF of the screen and camera. An X-ray monochromatic system has been established to measure the PSF accurately; and decrease the variation in the beam size between the theoretical values and the measured ones at SSRF.

The stripline BPM and cavity BPM processors share the same hardware platform and firmware; but the processing algorithms implemented in EPICS IOC on the ARM CPU are different. The capability of the ARM limits the processing speed to 10 bunches per second. Now the bunch rate of DCLS and SXFEL are going to increase from 10Hz to 50Hz. To meet the higher processing speed requirements; the processor firmware and software are upgraded in 2017. All BPM signal processing algorithms are implemented in FPGA; and EPICS IOC reads results only. After the upgrade; the processing speed reach 120 bunches per second.

The tuning algorithm searches for the minimum reflected power point and was developed to eliminate the highly temperature dependent phase measurement; which was previously used to tune the resonance frequency. Short and long term measurement results show that the tuning algorithm compensates for the RF heating effect as well as for diurnal temperature variations. Reflected power measurements of TRIUMF's DTL tank 3 were taken for both cases of operating the phase based tuning system and the reflected power based tuning system; with an outcome of a higher tuning accuracy of the newly developed system. Another advantage is a quick cavity start up time; as the reflected power based system does not rely on a reference set point which has do be adjusted manually.

ILC can be used to compensate for a repetitive disturbance like the beam loading effect in resonators. Assuming that the beam loading disturbance is identical for all iterations; the learning law can be non-causal; it can anticipate the disturbance and preemptively counteract its effect. In this work; we aim to use ILC to cancel beam loading effect on amplitude and phase. Feedback controllers are not fast enough for this purpose. A normal feed forward controller may not be sufficient as well if there is a difference between the feed forward signal and the beam loading current. Therefore; the goal is to use ILC to adaptively cancel the beam loading effect.,Funding: This research is supported by TRIUMF through federal funding via a contribution agreement with the National Research Council of Canada.,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpml083_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpml083.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpml083_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPML083,

As at injection and at flat top during slow extraction of the planned acceleration cycles the RF voltage will be relatively low; not all cavities will be active in this part of operation. It is important to analyse the impact of the inactive cavities on the overall RF voltage and subsequently their implication on the longitudinal particle dynamics. Classical approaches for reducing the beam impedance consist of active detuning of the cavities to pre-described parking frequencies. The fact that two out of ten buckets have to stay empty in all SIS100 scenarios is of particular interest as additional frequency components appear in the excitatory beam current; which have to be considered when the cavity is detuned. Therefore multi-cavity particle tracking simulations; consisting of twenty cavities and their attached LLRF control systems; are carried out in order to analyse different possibilities to minimize the impact on the beam dynamics and emittance growth.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpml088_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpml088.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpml088_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPML088,

To reduce longitudinal emittance blow-up; dedi- cated LLRF beam feedback systems are planned. To date; damping of longitudinal beam oscillations has been demon- strated in SIS18 machine experiments with a 3-tap filter controller (e.g. *); which is robust in regard to control pa- rameters and also to noise. On acceleration ramps the control parameters have to be adjusted to the varying synchrotron frequency. Previous results from beam experiments at GSI indicate that a proportional tuning rule for one parameter and an inversely proportional tuning rule for a second parameter is feasible; but the obtained damping rate may not be opti- mal for all synchrotron frequencies during the ramp. In this work; macro-particle simulations are performed to evaluate; whether it is sufficient to adjust the control parameters pro- portionally (inversely proportionally) to the change in the linear synchrotron frequency; or if it is necessary to take more pa- rameters; such as bunch-length and synchronous phase; into account to achieve stability and a considerable high damping rate for excited longitudinal dipole beam oscillations. This is done for single- and dual-harmonic acceleration ramps.; * H.

The technology is based on the detection of Cherenkov radiation; produced inside quartz fibres placed alongside the beampipe; from the interaction of secondary showers generated from losses hitting the vacuum pipe. This contribution presents ongoing developments of an oBLM system installed along the Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications (CLARA). The oBLM system consists of 4 channels which allows for sub-metre loss resolution with two dimensional coverage along the entirety of the beam line; as opposed to conventional localised BLM systems. The system was first commissioned to measure dark current from the injector. The ability of the system to locate longitudinal positions of known beam loss locations has also been measured and has shown excellent agreement. We present measurements acquired from the detector during regular operation and during dedicated beam tests. We also discuss the incorporation of the monitor into the accelerator diagnostics system and its use in assisting accelerator characterisation and performance.,Funding: Work supported by STFC Cockcroft Institute core Grant No. ST/G008248/1,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/thpml090_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/thpml090.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/thpml090_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-THPML090,

We focused on NbN which has a higher superconducting transition temperature than Nb. Firstly; we researched the optimal deposition condition for N2 gas reactive sputtering of NbN by using in-house inter-back type DC magnetron sputtering equipment. The critical condition for a thin film with strong crystalline orientation of NbN was identified. The superconducting transition temperature of the NbN thin film; which were coated under the best condition; was over 14 K. Secondly; we tried making S-I-S multilayered samples that was composed of NbN/SiO2/Nb substrate. The coating condition for the NbN layer was determined based on the research results in a single layer. The SiO2 layer was deposited with a film thickness of 30 nm that was theoretically expected to be effective as barrier layer. We applied O2 gas reactive AC magnetron sputtering for coating.

This will enable highly sophisticated longitudinal beam manipulations like longitudinal capture; compression and decompression or stacking of the beam. For the LLRF System; several requirements have to be fulfilled. Besides high standards concerning the pulsed gap signal quality (e.g. ringing <2.5%); the system has to provide the flexibility for adiabatic voltage ramp-up and adiabatic pulse shifting with high timing accuracy. A connection to the FAIR Central Control System (CCS) is necessary; as amplitude and phase ramp data will be provided by the CCS.

As a result; we obtained the equivalent signal levels taken by carbon wire made of polyacrylonitrile without any damage. In this paper; the signal response when the CNT is irradiated with an H− beam and the result of beam profile measurement. In addition; the surface of CNT after 3-MeV beam operation was observed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/frxgbd3_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/frxgbd3.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/frxgbd3_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-FRXGBD3,

A difference in the orbits can affect the accuracy of several fundamental experiments; e.g. precise comparison of the electron and positron spin frequencies (the CPT invari-ance test) [1]. In this case; the spin precession frequencies of particles should be compared within at least 5·10-9. The distinction of frequencies depends on the features of the radial orbits. Ideally; the difference in the electron and positron orbits is set only by distributed radiation losses of particle energy. The corresponding contribution to the total orbit distortions is called the Saw-Tooth effect orbit. Another example of possible precision experiment at VEPP-4M is search for the light speed anisotropy (LSA). In this case; it is necessary to ensure a stability of the difference in the radial orbits of electrons and positrons at a level of 1μm.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/frxgbd4_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/frxgbd4.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/frxgbd4_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-FRXGBD4,
ipac2018,,FRXGBE1,"Generation of High-Power, Tunable THz Radiation from Laser Interaction with a Relativistic Electron Beam",SLAC; Menlo Park; California; USA; This invited talk proposes a method based on the slice energy spread modulation to generate strong subpicoseond density bunching in high-intensity relativistic electron beams. A laser pulse with periodic intensity envelope is used to modulate the slice energy spread of the electron beam; which can then be converted into density modulation after a dispersive section. It is found that the double-horn slice energy distribution of the electron beam induced by the laser modulation is very eﬀective to increase the density modulation. Since the modulation is performed on a relativistic electron beam; the process does not suﬀer from strong space charge force or coupling between phase spaces. We show in both theory and simulations that the tunable radiation from the modulated beam can cover the frequency range of 1 ∼ 20 THz with high power and narrow-band spectra. This method can be used in storage ring or even thermal-cathode injectors with high-repetition rate. Experimental results will be reviewed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/frxgbe1_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/frxgbe1.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/frxgbe1_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-FRXGBE1,

The experimental method is to store a beam of polarized muons in a storage ring with pure vertical dipole field and electrostatic focusing; and to measure the precession frequency. Control of the systematics depends on unprecedented knowledge of the details of the phase space of the muon distribution. That knowledge is derived from direct measurements with scintillating fiber detectors that are inserted into the muon beam for diagnostic measurements; traceback straw tube tracking chambers; as well as the calorimeters that measure energy; time and position of the decay positrons. The interpretation of the measurements depends on a detailed model of the storage ring guide field.

The muon beam thus obtained has low emittance; meeting the requirement for the g-2/EDM experiment. J-PARC E34 experiment aims to measure the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2) with a precision of 0.1 ppm and search for EDM with a sensitivity to 10-21 e cm. The USM's are accelerated to 212 MeV by using a muon dedicated linac to be a ultra cold muon beam. The muon LINAC consists of an RFQ; a inter-digital H-mode DTL; disk and washer coupled cell structures; and disk loaded structures. The ultra-cold muons will have an extremely small transverse momentum spread of 0.1% with a normalized transverse emittance of around 1.5 pi mm-mrad. Proof of the slow muon acceleration scheme is an essential step to realize the world first muon linac. In October 2017; we have succeeded to accelerate slow negative muoniums generated using a simpler muonium source to 89 keV.

ipac2018,,FRYGB2,Applications of Compact Accelerators in Space for National Security,LANL; Los Alamos; New Mexico; USA; Relativistic electrons can oscillate above the Earth trapped in the radiation belts (known as the Van Allen Belts). These electrons; which can originate from the solar wind or a high-altitude nuclear explosion; have the potential to damage satellites in low-Earth orbit. For example; in 1962; the US detonated the Starfire warhead at an altitude of about 400 km. The unexpected resulting enhancement of the radiation belts disabled several satellites within a few months and energetic electrons remained trapped in the radiation belts for up to several years. In order to address this potential vulnerability; schemes have been proposed to drain electrons from the radiation belts; with the most promising based on using high-power RF waves to couple to the trapped electrons. This talk will provide an overview of radiation belt remediation including the use of electron accelerators to drive these RF waves.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/talks/frygb2_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/papers/frygb2.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ipac2018/posters/frygb2_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-FRYGB2,
