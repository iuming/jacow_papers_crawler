An upgrade done in the years 2015/2016 enables to use the S-DALINAC as an energy-recovery linac (ERL) [1]. The lattice is capable of a once- (up to 34 MeV) or twice-recirculating ERL operation (up to 68 MeV). For both modes dedicated beam dynamics simulations have been conducted. An important aspect is the effect of phase slippage and its influence on the quality of the decelerated beam. Furthermore",

            "where two beams of the same energy are transported through the same beam line. The commissioning of the different ERL modes started in 2017 and will be continued during upcoming beam times. This contribution will give an overview on the ERL modes at S-DALINAC. The beam dynamics simulations as well as diagnostics used will be discussed. Results and operational findings of the different ERL runs will be presented.",

The system architecture is chosen to enable additional coherent sources at longer wavelengths",

This match can be manipulated by both the magnetic lattice and the RF systems. Here we will present a few examples of systems and the longitudinal solutions found for each. The first application is a free-electron laser application where a short bunch and high peak current are required. The laser increases the energy spread and lowers the energy and this must be compensated in the ERL design. The second application is for an internal target experiment where the need was for small energy spread rather than a short bunch. The third example is for an electron cooler where the bunch must be very long with extremely small energy spread. The beam disruption due to cooling is small but CSR and microbunching effects are a real challenge. In the FEL",

It will be used for high precision particle physics experiments in two different operation modes: external beam (EB) mode (0.15 mA; 155 MeV) and energy recovery (ERL) mode (1 mA; 105 MeV). The recirculating main linac follows the concept of a double sided accelerator design with vertical stacking of return arcs. Up to three recirculations are possible. Acceleration is done by four TESLA/XFEL 9-cell SRF cavities located in two modified ELBE cryomodules. Within this contribution the recirculation optics for MESA will be presented. Main goals are achieving best energy spread at the experimental setups in recirculating ERL and non-ERL operation and providing small beta-functions within the cryomodules for minimizing HOM excitation at high beam currents.",

          "abstract": "The recirculating superconducting Darmstadt linear accelerator S-DALINAC [1] is one of the main research instruments at the institute for nuclear physics at the TU Darmstadt. It is operating in cw mode at beam currents of up to 20 uA with energies of up to 130 MeV using a thrice recirculating scheme. In 2010 the present digital low-level rf (LLRF) control system was set into operation. Since 2017 the S-DALINAC can be used as an energy recovery linac (ERL). The ERL mode is adjusted by shifting the phase of the beam by 180° in the second recirculation. The current setup of the LLRF control system is not optimized for the usage in an ERL operation. Therefore investigations in regard of the rf control performance have to be done. The first successful one turn ERL operation was set up in August 2017 where the rf control performance was investigated the first time in this new mode. In this talk the LLRF control system of the S-DALINAC is presented and its perfomance during an ERL operation is discussed.",

Our results confirm that dark lifetime (measured as 1/e decay of the quantum efficiency as function of time) of the GaAs activated using this method is improved by a factor 10. More importantly the operating lifetime (measured as 1/e decay of the quantum efficiency as function of the extracted charge) is improved by a factor 40 with respect to Cs-O activated GaAs operated under similar conditions. Such improvements on the lifetime are achieved at expenses of a slightly reduced QE and electron spin polarization."

The e-linac will have sufficient beam power to support the demands of other user community rare isotope beams. This driver accelerator could server as a production machine for high field THz radiation and as irradiation center. A recirculation of the beam would be beneficial for RIB production at higher beam energy and would allow for high bunch compression to generate THz radiation. Such a system would also allow for the investigation of a high beam intensity energy recovery linac. To this end",
            "TRIUMF is investigating the design of such a recirculation and the beam dynamics as a first step."

Following bunches are then deflected by the HOMs",

Similar to the rectangular waveguide",

These characteristics of the CSWG-type HOM coupler can solve the disadvantages of the conventional damping devices.

The unique feature of the gun is that a photocathode is held at room temperature. It allowed to preserve the quantum efficiency of Cs2KSb cathode which is adversely affected by cryogenic temperatures. Relatively low frequency permitted fully realize the accelerating field gradient what in turn helps to achieve 10 nC charge and 0.3 microns normalized emittance. We present the achieved performance and operational experience as well.",

It is used as a source of electron bunches for three powerful FEL-oscillators which operate in CW mode. In present configuration the ERL Injector comprises a 300-kV electrostatic gun with thermionic cathode",
            "as well as one bunching and two accelerating cavities separated by the drift space which is used for bunch compression. In near future the new RF gun will be added to this configuration. The basic requirement for the injector is to provide beam parameters necessary for FEL operation. These parameters include bunch charge more than 1 nQ and repetition rate about 10 MHz. Very small emittance and very short pulse duration are not required in our case because of long FEL radiation wavelength and low RF frequency of the main linac. We present detailed description of the injector setup and results of beam parameters measurements. The measured parameters are compared with simulation results. We also discuss future upgrade which includes installation of the new RF gun."

            "The high-current high-brightness electron accelerator for cooling of RHIC ions at low energy (LEReC) was successfully commissioned at BNL. A beam quality suitable for electron cooling has been achieved. Cooling of single ion bunches in RHIC using a new approach of bunched-beam electron cooling was demonstrated during 2019. To achieve such a cooling with non-magnetized electron beams and RF acceleration required proper beam manipulation in the longitudinal phase space while preserving transverse emittances. Electron beam with kinetic energy of 1.6 MeV with beam quality suitable for cooling was successfully propagated through 100 meters of beam lines including dispersion sections and maintained through both cooling sections in RHIC. The LEReC accelerator includes a photocathode DC gun",

          "abstract": "FEL oscillators usually operate in CW mode and produce periodic train of radiation pulses but some user experiments require modulation of radiation power. Conventional way to obtain this modulation is using of mechanical shutters however it cannot provide very short switching time and may lead to decreasing of the radiation beam quality. Another way could be based on the electron beam current modulation but it cannot be used in the ERL. We propose a simple way of fast control of the FEL lasing which is based on periodic phase shift of electron bunches with respect to radiation stored in optical cavity. The phase shift required to suppress lasing is relatively small and it does not change significantly repetition rate. This approach has been realized at NovoFEL facility. It allows to generate radiation macropulses of desirable length down to several microseconds (limited by quality factor of optical cavity and FEL gain) which can be synchronized with external trigger. We present detailed description of electronic power modulation scheme and discuss the results of experiments.",

The lattice is capable of a once- (up to 34 MeV) or twice-recirculating ERL operation (up to 68 MeV). For both modes dedicated beam dynamics simulations have been conducted. An important aspect is the effect of phase slippage and its influence on the quality of the decelerated beam. Furthermore",

This match can be manipulated by both the magnetic lattice and the RF systems. Here we will present a few examples of systems and the longitudinal solutions found for each. The first application is a free-electron laser application where a short bunch and high peak current are required. The laser increases the energy spread and lowers the energy and this must be compensated in the ERL design. The second application is for an internal target experiment where the need was for small energy spread rather than a short bunch. The third example is for an electron cooler where the bunch must be very long with extremely small energy spread. The beam disruption due to cooling is small but CSR and microbunching effects are a real challenge. In the FEL",
        "the longitudinal matching is mainly accomplished via lattice matching while in the cooler application the RF system is the dominant method to control the phase space. The internal target can be addressed either way."

The recirculating main linac follows the concept of a double sided accelerator design with vertical stacking of return arcs. Up to three recirculations are possible. Acceleration is done by four TESLA/XFEL 9-cell SRF cavities located in two modified ELBE cryomodules. Within this contribution the recirculation optics for MESA will be presented.

        "Superconducting cavities with two beam pipes have been proposed in the past for energy recovery linac applications. The relatively complex geometry of those cavities presented a serious challenge for fabrication and surface processing. Main concerns have now been overcome with the production and successful RF testing of a new elliptical twin-axis cavity proposed by Jefferson Lab and optimized by the Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University in the frame of a DoE accelerator stewardship program. The cavity design provides uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. This paper describes the cavity design",

It is operating in cw mode at beam currents of up to 20 uA with energies of up to 130 MeV using a thrice recirculating scheme. In 2010 the present digital low-level rf (LLRF) control system was set into operation. Since 2017 the S-DALINAC can be used as an energy recovery linac (ERL). The ERL mode is adjusted by shifting the phase of the beam by 180° in the second recirculation. The current setup of the LLRF control system is not optimized for the usage in an ERL operation. Therefore investigations in regard of the rf control performance have to be done. The first successful one turn ERL operation was set up in August 2017 where the rf control performance was investigated the first time in this new mode. In this talk the LLRF control system of the S-DALINAC is presented and its perfomance during an ERL operation is discussed.",

The e-linac will have sufficient beam power to support the demands of other user community rare isotope beams. This driver accelerator could server as a production machine for high field THz radiation and as irradiation center. A recirculation of the beam would be beneficial for RIB production at higher beam energy and would allow for high bunch compression to generate THz radiation. Such a system would also allow for the investigation of a high beam intensity energy recovery linac. To this end",

        "which results in even larger offsets for recirculated bunches. This feedback can even lead to beam loss. To measure the quality factors and frequencies for the dressed as well as undressed cavities improves the validity of any current limit estimation done."

        "they have some inherent disadvantages for high current in principle. We have proposed the new type of the HOM coupler using the C-shaped wave guide (CSWG). The CSWG is structured by topologically transforming a rectangular waveguide into coaxial-like structure whose inner and outer conductors are connected with a plate. Similar to the rectangular waveguide",
        "the CSWG has cutoff frequency whose half wave length is approximately equal to the mean circumference. This enables a smaller low-pass filter than the rectangular waveguide. Since the inner conductor can be easily cooled through the plate and the outer conductor",
        "this prevents the connector for HOM power extraction from temperature rising. These characteristics of the CSWG-type HOM coupler can solve the disadvantages of the conventional damping devices. The properties of sufficient HOM damping were confirmed by the measurements with the CSWG-type HOM couplers equipped to the cavity models."

The basic requirement for the injector is to provide beam parameters necessary for FEL operation. These parameters include bunch charge more than 1 nQ and repetition rate about 10 MHz. Very small emittance and very short pulse duration are not required in our case because of long FEL radiation wavelength and low RF frequency of the main linac.

To achieve such a cooling with non-magnetized electron beams and RF acceleration required proper beam manipulation in the longitudinal phase space while preserving transverse emittances.

      "abstract": "FEL oscillators usually operate in CW mode and produce periodic train of radiation pulses but some user experiments require modulation of radiation power. Conventional way to obtain this modulation is using of mechanical shutters however it cannot provide very short switching time and may lead to decreasing of the radiation beam quality. Another way could be based on the electron beam current modulation but it cannot be used in the ERL. We propose a simple way of fast control of the FEL lasing which is based on periodic phase shift of electron bunches with respect to radiation stored in optical cavity. The phase shift required to suppress lasing is relatively small and it does not change significantly repetition rate. This approach has been realized at NovoFEL facility. It allows to generate radiation macropulses of desirable length down to several microseconds (limited by quality factor of optical cavity and FEL gain) which can be synchronized with external trigger. We present detailed description of electronic power modulation scheme and discuss the results of experiments.",
