        "Future electron-ion colliders collide high-intensity ion beams with high current electron beams. The electron beams take advantage of synchrotron radiation to damp emittances but the ion beams must be cooled via a beam cooling mechanism",
        "including electron cooling. The ion energies are typically a few hundreds of GeV per nucleon",
        "for an electron-ion collider envisioned to be built in US. At this energy",
        "DC coolers powered by electrostatic accelerators",
        "are not useful. The ERL",
        "in principle",
        "can provide the high current and brightness to cool these high-brightness ion beams. The beam quality requirements are much different from previous ERLs designs used for FELs. The cooling bunch must be much longer than in an FEL and the relative energy spread must be very small. Incoherent cooling can be enhanced with magnetized beams",
        "but the magnetization must be maintained throughout the ERL. An alternate cooling mechanism",
        "the so-called Coherent Electron Cooling",
        "is",
        "in principle",
        "stronger and can be done with non-magnetized beams. We will present several applications of ERLs to high energy electron cooling and describe the technical challenges that must be overcome to build such an ERL."

        "In order to use an ERL as a test facility for SRF equipment",
        "it must have sufficient flexibility built in to allow tests at different acceleration voltages and frequencies. With help of a DC photo-cathode",
        "operation at diverse frequencies is possible even if the injector buncher/booster is operating at a fixed frequency. To this end",
        "the laser should pulse at a subharmonic n of this frequency. Possible test frequencies in the ERL are then any harmonic of this subharmonic",
        "which allows for tests at many frequencies. With n=33",
        "we could reach all usual frequencies up to 1.3 GHz. To reach this flexibility it is equally required to adapt the path length in the ERL by approximately ±λ/2 of the smallest envisaged test frequency",
        "so typically some 50 cm",
        "for example with adjustable girders. For a multi-turn ERL",
        "the fields in the return arc magnets must be individually controllable to allow for different accelerating voltages in the SRF device under test. Once these conditions are satisfied",
        "an ERL allows for tests of SRF equipment with large beam powers but relatively little power consumption."
