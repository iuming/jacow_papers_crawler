        "Superconducting cavities with two beam pipes have been proposed in the past for energy recovery linac applications. The relatively complex geometry of those cavities presented a serious challenge for fabrication and surface processing. Main concerns have now been overcome with the production and successful RF testing of a new elliptical twin-axis cavity proposed by Jefferson Lab and optimized by the Center for Accelerator Science at Old Dominion University in the frame of a DoE accelerator stewardship program. The cavity design provides uniform accelerating or decelerating fields for both beams. This paper describes the cavity design",
        "fabrication experience",
        "and the first cold RF test results and explores potential applications especially for the proposed Jefferson Lab electron-ion Collider (JLEIC)."

Despite the different goals for future operation and achievable beam current the main linac cryomodule of MESA is planned to be integrated into the BERLinPro ring in order to perform high current beam tests. This unique opportunity is beneficial for both projects. Nevertheless",
