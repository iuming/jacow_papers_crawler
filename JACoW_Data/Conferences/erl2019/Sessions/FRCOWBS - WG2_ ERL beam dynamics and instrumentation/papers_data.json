        "high-brightness accelerator featuring ~100 m of beamline and is designed to operate with 1.6-2.6 MeV electron beams of up to 140 kW beam power. The LEReC requires a dedicated machine protection system (MPS) capable of interlocking electron beam within 40 us and is equipped with multiple levels of protection. In this paper we summarize our experience with designing",

        "The high-current high-brightness electron accelerator for cooling of RHIC ions at low energy (LEReC) was successfully commissioned at BNL. A beam quality suitable for electron cooling has been achieved. Cooling of single ion bunches in RHIC using a new approach of bunched-beam electron cooling was demonstrated during 2019. To achieve such a cooling with non-magnetized electron beams and RF acceleration required proper beam manipulation in the longitudinal phase space while preserving transverse emittances. Electron beam with kinetic energy of 1.6 MeV with beam quality suitable for cooling was successfully propagated through 100 meters of beam lines including dispersion sections and maintained through both cooling sections in RHIC. The LEReC accelerator includes a photocathode DC gun",

        "and a set of Normal Conducting RF cavities to provide sufficient flexibility to tune the beam in the longitudinal phase space. In this paper we discuss experience learned during LEReC beam commissioning."

        "The typical requirement of Energy Recovery Linacs to produce beams with high repetition rate and high bunch charge presents unique demands on beam diagnostics. ERLs being quite sensitive to time of flight effects necessitate the use of beam arrival time monitors along with typical position detection. Being subjected to a plethora of dynamic effects",
        "both longitudinal and transverse phase space monitoring of the beam becomes quite important. Additionally",
        "beam halo plays an important role determining the overall transmission. Consequently",
        "we also need to characterize halo both directly using sophisticated beam viewers and indirectly using radiation monitors. In this talk",
        "I will describe the instrumentation essential to ERL operation using the Cornell-BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA) as a pertinent example."
