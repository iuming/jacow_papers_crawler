        "The currently installed configuration of TRIUMF’s superconducting electron linac (e-linac) can produce an electron beam up to 30MeV and 10mA. Low beam power commissioning of the segment spanning the electron gun to high energy dump took place in summer 2018 with an attained beam energy of 25MeV. As the driver of the ARIEL project",
        "the e-linac will deliver electrons to a photo-converter target station for the production of neutron-rich rare isotope beams (RIB) via photo fission. The e-linac will have sufficient beam power to support the demands of other user community rare isotope beams. This driver accelerator could server as a production machine for high field THz radiation and as irradiation center. A recirculation of the beam would be beneficial for RIB production at higher beam energy and would allow for high bunch compression to generate THz radiation. Such a system would also allow for the investigation of a high beam intensity energy recovery linac. To this end",
        "TRIUMF is investigating the design of such a recirculation and the beam dynamics as a first step."

SRF Gun II features a 3.5-cell niobium cavity as well as a superconducting solenoid in the same cryomodule. With Mg photocathodes the gun is able to provide medium current beam with bunch charge of more than 200 pC and sub-ps bunch length at 100 kHz repetition rate.
