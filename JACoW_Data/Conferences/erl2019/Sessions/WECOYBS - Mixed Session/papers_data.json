        "FCC ee and eRHIC. Examples of smaller energy ERL’s with a single FFA-LG beam lines are shown as well. The large energy ERL’s require fixed field triplet quadrupoles inside of the superconducting linacs. Electrons from the linac pass through the FFA-LG single return line made of two parts: the adiabatic transition beam line where the cell lengths decreases adiabatically and the arc section with repetitive triplet cells. The time of flight of different energies are corrected by additional orbit oscillations of smaller and higher energies as the FFA-LG time of flight dependence is a parabolic function with respect to the energy.",

The field distribution of the modes will be shown and asymmetric field distribution of HOMs will be demonstrated and HOMs excitations using dipole couplers will be discussed. The original design of the dual axis asymmetric cavity has been optimised to minimize the peaks of magnetic and electric fields on the cavity surface",
        "to increase the distance between operating mode and neighbouring parasitic mode as well as to reduce the cavity manufacturing cost. To reach the goals several solutions have been suggested leading to simplification of the manufacturing as well as bringing the fields amplitudes on the cavity surface to the acceptable values. The new design of the cavity will be presented and possible applications of such a high-current ERL will be discussed."
