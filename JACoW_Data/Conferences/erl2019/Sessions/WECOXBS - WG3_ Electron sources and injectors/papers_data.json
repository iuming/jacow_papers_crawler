        "Photoinjector driven electron accelerators place stringent requirements on the photocathodes used. This is primarily due to the fact that the properties of the generated electron bunch are crucially defined by the material properties of the photocathode employed. To generate high brightness and high average current a photocathode with high QE and low intrinsic emittance is required. Furthermore",
        "to be of practical use",
        "the material must be robust and exhibit a long lifetime to deliver stable beam. Bi-alkali antimonides are suitable candidates; they exhibit high quantum efficiencies and can be operated close to the photoemission threshold",
        "thus enabling the generation of high current and low emittance electron beams. At HZB bi-alkali antimonides are the choice photocathode materials to drive the BERLinPro energy recovery linac. In this talk we present studies conducted at HZB to develop the optimal growth procedure for Cs-K-Sb and Na-K-Sb photocathodes with respect to QE and lifetime measurements."
