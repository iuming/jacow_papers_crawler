        "The S-DALINAC is a superconducting electron accelerator operated at TU Darmstadt. It is running in recirculating operation since 1991. An upgrade done in the years 2015/2016 enables to use the S-DALINAC as an energy-recovery linac (ERL) [1]. The lattice is capable of a once- (up to 34 MeV) or twice-recirculating ERL operation (up to 68 MeV). For both modes dedicated beam dynamics simulations have been conducted. An important aspect is the effect of phase slippage and its influence on the quality of the decelerated beam. Furthermore",
        "investigations regarding specialized diagnostic systems are currently ongoing. This is of great importance especially for the twice-recirculating ERL",
        "where two beams of the same energy are transported through the same beam line. The commissioning of the different ERL modes started in 2017 and will be continued during upcoming beam times. This contribution will give an overview on the ERL modes at S-DALINAC. The beam dynamics simulations as well as diagnostics used will be discussed. Results and operational findings of the different ERL runs will be presented.",
