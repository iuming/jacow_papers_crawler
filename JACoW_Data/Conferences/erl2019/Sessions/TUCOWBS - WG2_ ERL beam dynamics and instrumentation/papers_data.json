        "Both the dynamics and the architecture of an energy recovery linac are primarily determined by the longitudinal match. This match can be manipulated by both the magnetic lattice and the RF systems. Here we will present a few examples of systems and the longitudinal solutions found for each. The first application is a free-electron laser application where a short bunch and high peak current are required. The laser increases the energy spread and lowers the energy and this must be compensated in the ERL design. The second application is for an internal target experiment where the need was for small energy spread rather than a short bunch. The third example is for an electron cooler where the bunch must be very long with extremely small energy spread. The beam disruption due to cooling is small but CSR and microbunching effects are a real challenge. In the FEL",
        "the longitudinal matching is mainly accomplished via lattice matching while in the cooler application the RF system is the dominant method to control the phase space. The internal target can be addressed either way."

        "Collective effects such as coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) can have a strong influence of the properties of an electron bunch. In particular",
        "CSR experienced by a bunch on a curved trajectory can increase the transverse emittance of a beam. In this contribution",
        "we present an extension to the well-established 1D theory of CSR by accounting fully for the forces experienced in the entrance and exit transients of a bending magnet. A new module of the General Particle Tracer (GPT) tracking code was developed for this study",
        "showing good agreement with theory. In addition to this analysis",
        "we present experimental measurements of the emittance growth experienced in the FERMI bunch compressor chicane as a function of bunch length. When the bunch undergoes extreme compression",
        "the 1D theory breaks down and is no longer valid. A comparison between the 1D theory",
        "experimental measurements and a number of codes which simulate CSR differently are presented",
        "showing better agreement when the transverse properties of the bunch are taken into account."

        "the established simulation code Bmad has been used to track a bunch with different CSR parameters. We found that CSR causes phase space dilution",
        "and the effect becomes more significant as the bunch charge and recirculation pass increase. Convergence tests have been performed for the CSR parameters to validate the observed micro-bunching instability. Potential ways to mitigate the effect involving vacuum chamber shielding and increasing bunch length are also being investigated."
