MESA uses two 1.3 GHz TESLA type cavities with 12.5 MV/m of accelerating gradient in a modified ELBE type cryomodule in c.w. operation. One potential limit to maximum beam current in ERLs is the transverse beam breakup (BBU) instability induced by dipole HOMs. These modes can be excited by bunches passing through the cavities off axis. Following bunches are then deflected by the HOMs",
        "which results in even larger offsets for recirculated bunches. This feedback can even lead to beam loss. To measure the quality factors and frequencies for the dressed as well as undressed cavities improves the validity of any current limit estimation done."
