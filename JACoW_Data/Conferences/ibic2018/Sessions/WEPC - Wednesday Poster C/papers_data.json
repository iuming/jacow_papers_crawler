        "three of which are dedicated to clinical operation and a fourth one to non-clinical research. Commissioning of all fixed lines has been completed for protons",

The transverse beam emittance in the MedAustron synchrotron is measured via scraping at non-dispersive regions of the ring. The analysis procedure as well as emittance reconstruction accuracy for simulated data will be described in this paper",

The radiation can be detected using standard cameras that provide information on the two-dimensional particle distribution.

The superconducting accelerator for up to 17.5 GeV electrons will provide photons simultaneously to several user stations. Currently 12 Wire Scanner units are used to image transverse beam profiles in the high energy sections. These scanners provide a slow scan mode which is currently used to measure beam emittance and beam halo distributions. When operating with long bunch trains (>100 bunches) also fast scans are planned to measure beam sizes in an almost nondestructive manner. Scattered electrons can be detected with regular Beam Loss Monitors (BLM) as well as dedicated wire scanner detectors. Latter are installed in different variants at certain positions in the machine. Further developments are ongoing to optimize the sensitivity of the detectors to be able to measure both",
