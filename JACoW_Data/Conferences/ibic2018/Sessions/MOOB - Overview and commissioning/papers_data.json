The proton beam is extracted from the J-PARC main ring proton synchrotron (MR) into the primary beamline. The beamline is currently operated with 485kW MR beam power. The MR beam power is planned to be upgraded to 1.3+ MW. The neutrino production target could be damaged if the high intensity beam hits off-centered on the target",
        "due to non-uniform thermal stress. Therefore",
        "in order to protect the target",

        "was recently developed and commissioned. This module reads out signals from a titanium-strip-based secondary emission profile monitor (SSEM) which is placed in the primary beamline. An overview of the upgrade plan of the MPS system and the results of an initial evaluation test of the new interlock module will be discussed."
