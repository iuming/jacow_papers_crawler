        "Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have grown in size and performance for several orders of magnitude. As the FPGA capabilities have grown",
        "so have the designs. It seems that current tools and languages (VHDL and (System)Verilog) do not match the complexity required for advanced digital signal processing (DSP) systems usually found in experimental physics applications. In the last couple of years several commercial High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools have emerged",
        "providing a new method to implement FPGA designs",
        "or at least some parts of it. By providing a higher level of abstraction",
        "new tools offer a possibility to express algorithms in a way which is closer to the mathematical description. Such implementation is understood by a broader range of people",
        "and thus minimizes the documentation and communication issues. Several examples of DSP algorithms relevant for beam instrumentation will be presented. Implementations of these algorithms with different HLS tools and traditional implementation in VHDL will be compared."

A high-speed data acquisition system capable of acquiring 2 channels at 800 MSP/s will be presented. As first model application of the versatile digitizer board is the coarse bunch arrival time diagnostics in the free electron laser FLASH at DESY."

The HNFS technique consists of a suspension of nanoparticles suspended in a liquid and illuminated by synchrotron radiation (either in the visible or in X-ray wavelength range). The transverse coherence of the source",

        "Optical pulses and particle beams with ultrashort temporal duration have been powerful probes for capturing ultrafast processes. An X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) based on the self-amplified spontaneous emission scheme is a newly developed ultrafast light source with femtosecond duration. The ultrafast XFEL pulses are generated from the electron bunches (e-bunches) that are accelerated to a relativistic speed with strong compression to a femtosecond regime. Evaluation of the temporal profile of the e-bunch is therefore essential for optimizing accelerator parameters for achieving XFEL amplification",
        "as well as for characterizing the XFEL pulse duration. As a new temporal diagnostic scheme for e-bunches",
        "we recently propose an X-ray intensity interferometry using spontaneous X-ray beam generated by the e-bunch [1]. In this presentation",
