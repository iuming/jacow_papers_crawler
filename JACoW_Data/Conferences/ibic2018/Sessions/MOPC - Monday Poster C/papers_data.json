        "The accuracy and stability of beam position moni-tors(BPMs) are important for all kinds of measurement systems and feedback systems in particle accelerator field. A proper method detecting faulty beam position monitor or monitoring their stability could optimize accel-erator operating conditions. With development in ma-chine learning methods",
        "a series of powerful analysis approaches make it possible for detecting beam position monitor’s stability. Here",
        "this paper proposed a clustering analysis approach to detect the defective BPMs. The method is based on the idea that cluster centres are char-acterized by a higher density than their neighbours and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densi-ties. The results showed that clustering by fast search and find of density peaks could classify beam data into dif-ferent clusters on the basis of their similarity. And that",
        "aberrant data points could be detected by decision graph. So the algorithm is appropriate for BPM detecting and it could be a significant supplement for data analysis in accelerator physics."

        "it has high demand for DBPM system performance. Considering the crosstalk may introduce distortion and influence beam position resolution",
        "it is important to analyze and compensate the crosstalk to improve the resolution. We choose the CBPM signal to study the crosstalk for its narrowband and sensitive for phase. The main experiment concept is successive accessing four channels to form a signal transfer matrix",
        "which including amplitude frequency response and phase response information. And the compensation algorithm is acquire four channel readouts",
        "then using the signal transfer matrix to reverse the true signal to ensure the accurate beam position measurement. This concept has already been tested at SXFEL and hopeful to compensate the crosstalk sufficiently."

An inference engine is one key component in the expert system. We are developing a Machine-Learning(ML) based inference engine for our expert system. ML is one of the most active research fields in computing",

An EPICS IOC was built and run on RedPitaya for accessing the device driver. A CSS-based user interface shows the signal’s power spectra and the tune frequency directly."
