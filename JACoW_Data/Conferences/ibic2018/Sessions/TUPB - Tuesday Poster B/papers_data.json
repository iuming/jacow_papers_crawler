      "abstract": "An extreme operation mode such as the BESSY-VSR conditions stimulates the development of a high accuracy bunch-by-bunch beam-position monitor (BPM) system which is compatible with the bunch-selective operation for the orbit feedback system. Such a system will also greatly benefit to accelerator R&D such as transverse resonance island buckets (TRIBs). Compensation of the long-range ringing signal produced by the combined effect of impedance mismatching inside the button and trapped TE-modes in the aluminum-oxide insulator (Al2O3) material is required essentially to improve the resolution. This is important since the ringing causes a misreading of the beam position and current of following bunches. We show the design study of a new button-type BPM to mitigate the influence of the ringing signal as well as to reduce wake losses by improving the impedance matching in the button and by replacing the insulator material. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-",

Recent developments on pilot tone capable front end have been tested with an established BPM readout electronics. The goal was to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pilot tone compensation to varying external conditions. Simulated cable attenuation change and temperature variation of the readout electronics were confirmed to have no major effect to position data readout. The output signals from Elettra front end (carrier frequency and pilot tone frequency) were processed by a Libera Spark with the integrated standard front end which contains several filtering",
        "attenuation and amplification stages. Tests were repeated with a modified instrument (optimized for pilot tone) to compare the long-term stability results. Findings show the pilot tone front end enables great features like self-diagnostics and cable-fault compensation as well as small improvement in the long-term stability. Measurement resolution is in range of 10 nanometers RMS in 5 Hz bandwidth."
