ibic2018,,MOOA02,Noise in Radio/Optical Communications,University of Ljubljana; Faculty of Electrical Engineering; Ljubljana; Slovenia; Noise is a random signal that affects the performance of all electronic and/or optical devices. Although the sources of different kinds of noise have their backgrounds in physics; engineers dealing with noise use different methods and units to specify noise. The intention of this tutorial is to describe the main effects of noise in electronics up to optical frequencies while providing links between the physics and engineering worlds. In particular; noise is considered harmful while degrading the signal-to-noise ratio or broadening the spectrum of signal sources. On the other hand; noise can be itself a useful signal. Finally; artificially generated signals that exhibit many properties of random natural noise are sometimes required.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/mooa02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/mooa02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/mooa02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOOA02,1

ibic2018,,MOOB02,"Design of Beam Diagnostics System for Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility, RAON",H.J. Woo; Y.S. Chung; G.D. Kim; IBS; Daejeon; Republic of Korea; Korea University; Seoul; Republic of Korea; The ultimate goal of the superconducting LINAC at RISP is to accelerate uranium and proton beams up to 200 MeV/u and 600 MeV; with a maximum beam currents of 8.3 pµA and 660 pµA; respectively. The driver linac is divided into several sections: low energy superconducting linac SCL1 for stable ions and SCL3 for rare isotopes; charge stripper section; and high energy superconducting linac (SCL2). Various types of beam diagnostic devices such as beam current monitor; beam position monitor (BPM); beam profile monitor; beam phase monitor; and beam loss monitor; etc. are required for the setting of accelerator parameters; the monitoring and control of beam acceleration and transport; and improvement of accelerator system. The arrangement of beam diagnostic devices was initially based on the result of beam dynamics calculation; and now the overall layout becomes almost settled. More than 600 devices will be installed for commissioning and normal operation. This report introduces the overall layout of the beam diagnostic system and present status of the system construction.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/moob02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/moob02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/moob02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOOB02,

ibic2018,,MOOB04,Upgrade of the Machine Protection System Toward 1.3 MW Operation of the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline,K. Sakashita; M.L. Friend; K. Nakayoshi; KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; Y. Koshio; S. Yamasu; Okayama University; Faculty of Science; Okayama City; Japan; The machine protection system (MPS) is one of the essential components to realize safe operation of the J-PARC neutrino beamline; where a high intensity neutrino beam for the T2K long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is generated by striking 30GeV protons on a graphite target. The proton beam is extracted from the J-PARC main ring proton synchrotron (MR) into the primary beamline. The beamline is currently operated with 485kW MR beam power. The MR beam power is planned to be upgraded to 1.3+ MW. The neutrino production target could be damaged if the high intensity beam hits off-centered on the target; due to non-uniform thermal stress. Therefore; in order to protect the target; it is important to immediately stop the beam when the beam orbit is shifted. A new FPGA-based interlock module; with which the beam profile is calculated in real time; was recently developed and commissioned. This module reads out signals from a titanium-strip-based secondary emission profile monitor (SSEM) which is placed in the primary beamline. An overview of the upgrade plan of the MPS system and the results of an initial evaluation test of the new interlock module will be discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/moob04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/moob04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/moob04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOOB04,18

Shanghai soft X-ray free-electron laser (SXFEL) started construc-tion in 2015 and is now in the commission phase. Al-though integrated current transformer (ICT) were installed in the entire FEL for the measurement of the absolute beam charge; the accurate measurement becomes difficult in the injector and the main accelerator section due to the noise interference from external factors such as klystron modulator. The evaluation of the source of noise signals and the procession of noise reduction using the principal component analysis (PCA) are proposed in this paper. Experiment results show that PCA method can effectively remove the interference of lower frequency noise from the klystron modulator and it can also improve the resolution of the ICT system. Detailed experiment results and data analysis will be mentioned as well.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/mooc03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/mooc03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/mooc03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOOC03,22
ibic2018,,MOOC04,Bunch Charge Monitor for the ALS Upgrade,S. De Santis; D. Lipresenter; W.E. Norum; G.J. Portmann; LBNL; Berkeley; California; USA; The ALS upgrade project (ALS-U) consists in the replacement of the existing ALS storage ring with a new storage and accumulator rings. Due to the reduced lifetime of the ultra-low emittance beam circulating in the new storage ring; trains of 25/26 bunches have to be swapped between storage and accumulator every 30-60 seconds. The depleted train swapped out to the accumulator is topped back to its nominal charge from the injector and swapped back into the storage ring at the next injection cycle. Monitoring the bunch charge and parasitic bunches is necessary to minimize stored current variations in the storage ring and beam losses during the injection/extraction process. We present a bunch charge monitor based on a broadband analog-to-digital converter that allows to sample the signal obtained from a beam pickup at a frequency resulting in a scan of the entire ring with a ~60 ps resolution every 60 microseconds. Hundreds of scans are accumulated to obtain the necessary charge resolution. The beam pickup has been designed to be insensitive to the beam transverse position and its response to a bunch passage decays so rapidly that the readout is not affected by adjacent bunches.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/mooc04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/mooc04.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/mooc04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOOC04,

This choice is motivated by the ease of operation inside vacuum chambers; absence of power-supplies and feedthroughs; and potentially lower cost. Indeed; in these experiments space is at premium; and compactness is frequently required. At the same time; these magnets have to have a large angular acceptance for the divergent laser and electron beams which imposes constraint of the gap size. We will present the optimized design and characterization of a 100 mm long; 2.1 Tesla permanent magnet dipole.

Direct measurement of the beam energy can be difficult; long or even not possible with acceptable accuracy and precision in some machines such as ESRF. Since the energy spectrum of the Synchrotron Radiation (SR) depends on the beam energy; it is indeed possible to relate the variation of the beam energy with a variation of the produced SR flux.

It delivers electron beams in cw-mode with energies up to 130 MeV. The high-energy scraper system has been installed in its extraction beam line to reduce the energy spread and improve the energy stability of the beam for the experiments operated downstream. It comprises three scraper slits within a dispersion-conserving chicane consisting of four dipole magnets and eight quadrupole magnets. The primary scraper; located in a dispersive section; allows to improve and stabilize the energy spread. In addition energy fluctuations can be detected. Scraping of x- and y-halo is implemented in two positions enclosing the position of the primary scraper. We will present technical details and results of the first commissioning run of the recently installed system at the S DALINAC.

This transverse kick depends on the beam trans-verse position and beam parameters such as the bunch length and the total bunch charge. In the orbit bump method; the transverse kick factor of an ID is estimated through the closed orbit distortion (COD) measurement at many BPMs for various beam currents [1]. In the present study; we created an orbit bump of 1 mm using four steering magnets; and then measured the COD for two cases: when the gap is opened (the gap size is 42 mm) and when the gap is closed (the gap size is 3.83 mm).

When the SRF cavity is transitioning from the non-conducting to the Superconducting state at the critical temperature (Tc); the ambient magnetic field can be trapped. This trapped flux may lead to an increase in the surface resistance of the cavity wall; which can reduce the Q-factor and efficiency of the cavity. In order to increase the Q-factor; it is important to lower the surface resistance by reducing the amount of magnetic flux trapped in the cavity wall to sub 10mG range during the Tc transition. In this paper; we present a 3-axis automatic active magnetic field compensation system that is capable of reducing the earth magnetic field and any local disturbance field. Design techniques are described to enhance the system stability while utilizing the flexibility of embedded electronics. This paper describes the system implementation and concludes with initial results of tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed magnetic field compensation system can reduce the earth magnetic field to around 2.5 mG even without shielding.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/mopb13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/mopb13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/mopb13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-MOPB13,101

A proper method detecting faulty beam position monitor or monitoring their stability could optimize accel-erator operating conditions. With development in ma-chine learning methods; a series of powerful analysis approaches make it possible for detecting beam position monitor’s stability. Here; this paper proposed a clustering analysis approach to detect the defective BPMs. The method is based on the idea that cluster centres are char-acterized by a higher density than their neighbours and by a relatively large distance from points with higher densi-ties. The results showed that clustering by fast search and find of density peaks could classify beam data into dif-ferent clusters on the basis of their similarity.

The first prototype for SSRF storage ring was completed in 2012; with turn-by-turn resolution better than 1μm. From 2016 to 2017; SSRF successively constructed two FEL facilities in China; DCLS and SXFEL test facilities. The second ver-sion DBPM was developed and used in large scale during this period to meet the requirements of signal processing for stripline BPMs and cavity BPMs. After that; we turned to the development of DBPM for SSRF storage ring based on the second version hardware; including FPGA firmware; EPICS IOC; EDM control panel. The development was completed and tests were carried out in early 2018. Test results showed that the position data is accurate and can monitor beam movement correctly; and online turn-by-turn position data resolution reaches 0.46μm.

Considering the crosstalk may introduce distortion and influence beam position resolution; it is important to analyze and compensate the crosstalk to improve the resolution. We choose the CBPM signal to study the crosstalk for its narrowband and sensitive for phase. The main experiment concept is successive accessing four channels to form a signal transfer matrix; which including amplitude frequency response and phase response information. And the compensation algorithm is acquire four channel readouts; then using the signal transfer matrix to reverse the true signal to ensure the accurate beam position measurement.

To generate a high intensity neutrino beam; a high intensity proton beam is extracted from a 30GeV Main Ring Synchrotron (MR) to the neutrino primary beamline. In the beamline; one mistaken shot can potentially do serious damage to beamline equipment. To avoid such a consequence; many beamline equipment interlocks to stop the beam operation are implemented. Once an interlock is activated; prompt and proper error handling is necessary. We are developing an expert system for prompt and efficient understanding of the status to quickly resume the beam operation. An inference engine is one key component in the expert system.

Conventional XBPMs work in the direct-current (DC) mode; because it is difficult to measure a beam position in the pulse mode under the sever heat load condition. The key point of the design is aiming at improving heat-resistance property without degradation of high frequency property [1]. This monitor is equipped with microstripline structure for signal transmission line to achieve pulse-by-pulse beam position signal. A photocathode is titanium electrode that is sputtered on a diamond heat sink to achieve high heat resistance. We have manufactured the prototype; and demonstrated feasibility at the SPring-8 bending magnet beamline. As a result; we observed a unipolar single pulse with the pulse length of less than 1 ns FWHM and confirmed that it has pulse-by-pules position sensitivity [2].

J Synchrotron Radiat; 2015. 22(4): p. 946-55.,,We report on a system (ps-BPM) that can measure the electron source position and angular motion at a single location in a synchrotron bend magnet beamline using a combination of a monochromator and an absorber with a K-edge to which the monochromator was tuned in energy. The vertical distribution of the beam was visualized with an imaging detector where horizontally one part of the beam was with the absorber and the other part with no absorber. The small range of angles from the source onto the monochromator crystals creates an energy range that allows part of the beam to be below the K-edge and the other part above. Measurement of the beam vertical location without the absorber and edge vertical location with the absorber gives the source position and angle. Measurements were made to investigate the possibility of using the ps-BPM to correct experimental imaging data. We have introduced periodic electron beam motion using a correction coil in the storage ring lattice. The measured and predicted motions compared well for two different frequencies. We then show that measurement of the beam width and edge width gives information about the vertical electron source size and angular distribution.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/tuob04_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/tuob04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/tuob04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-TUOB04,186

Injecting a fixed reference tone upstream of cables allows for a continuous calibration of the system; compensating the different behaviour of every channel due to thermal drifts; variations of cable properties; mismatches and tolerances of components. The system ran successfully as a drop-in substitute for a Libera Electron not only during various machine shifts; but also during a user dedicated beamtime shift for more than 10 hours; behaving in a transparent way for all the control systems and users. The equivalent RMS noise (at 10 kHz data rate) for the pilot tone position was less than 200 nm on a 19 mm vacuum chamber radius; with a long-term stability better than 1 um in a 12-hour window. Two main steps led to this important result: firstly; the development of a novel RF front end that adds the pilot tone to the signals originated by the beam; secondly; the realisation of an FPGA-based double digital receiver that demodulates both beam and pilot amplitudes; calculating the compensated X and Y positions.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/tuoc01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/tuoc01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/tuoc01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-TUOC01,190

A new type of neutron BLM have been developed for hadron accelerators aiming to cover the low energy part. In this region typical BLMs based on charged particle detection are not appropriate because the expected particle fields will be dominated by neutrons and photons. Moreover; the photon background due to the RF cavities can produce false beam loss signals. The BLM proposed is based on gaseous Micromegas detectors; designed to be sensitive to fast neutrons and insensitive to photons (X and gamma). In addition; the detectors will be insensitive to thermal neutrons; since part of them will not be directly correlated to beam loss location. The appropriate configuration of the Micromegas operating conditions will allow excellent timing; intrinsic photon background suppression and individual neutron counting; extending thus the dynamic range to very low particle fluxes.

These chambers are 3 to 4m long and are positioned around the inside of the synchrotron as well as along the ISIS Linac and Extracted Proton Beamlines (EPBs). To achieve finer spatial resolution a programme has been implemented to install six scintillator Beam Loss Monitors (BLMs); each 300 mm long; inside each of the ten main dipole magnets. Using these scintillator BLMs the accelerator can be fine-tuned during set-up to reduce areas of beam loss that were previously unseen or hard to characterise. As the installation programme comes to an end; this paper will review: the installation of the scintillator BLMs; the electronic hardware and software used to control them; and the initial measurements that have been taken using them.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/tupa14_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/tupa14.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/tupa14_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-TUPA14,236

Even tiny proportions of the 7TeV beam have the stored energy to quench the superconducting magnets or damage parts of the accelerator if left unchecked. Particle absorbing Low-Z material make up the active area of the collimator (jaws). Various beam impact scenarios can induce significant temperature gradients that cause deformation of the jaws. This can lead to a reduction in beam cleaning efficiency which can have a detrimental effect on beam dynamics. This has led to research into a new Adaptive collimation system (ACS). The ACS is a re-design of a current collimator already in use at CERN. The ACS will incorporate a novel fibre based measurement system and piezoceramic actuators mounted within the body of the collimator to maintain jaw straightness below the 100µm specification. These two systems working in tandem can monitor; and correct for; the jaw structural deformation for all impact events.

Such a system will also greatly benefit to accelerator R&D such as transverse resonance island buckets (TRIBs). Compensation of the long-range ringing signal produced by the combined effect of impedance mismatching inside the button and trapped TE-modes in the aluminum-oxide insulator (Al2O3) material is required essentially to improve the resolution. This is important since the ringing causes a misreading of the beam position and current of following bunches. We show the design study of a new button-type BPM to mitigate the influence of the ringing signal as well as to reduce wake losses by improving the impedance matching in the button and by replacing the insulator material. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/tupb04_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/tupb04.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/tupb04_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-TUPB04,265

Many accelerating cavities are equipped with HOMBPMs (Higher Order Mode based Beam Position Monitors) to align the beam and monitor the transverse beam position.

Those senors are able to deliver a time precision <100 ps and can handle rate capabilities up to 107 particles/channel. The read-out of the sensors is based on the TRB3 system [1]. Precise FPGA-TDCs (264 channels; <10 ps RMS) are implemented inside FPGAs. The TRB3 system serves as data acquisition system with scaler capability.

In order to measure the beam transverse quadrupole oscillation in the injection stage for the HLS-II storage ring; some axially symmetric stripline BPMs were designed. Transverse quadrupole component for these BPMs was simulated and off-line calibrated. Beam transverse quadrupole oscillation has been measured when beam was injected into the HLS-II electron storage ring. The spectrum of the transverse quadrupole component showed that beam transverse quadrupole oscillation is very obvious in the injection stage and this oscillation isn’t the second harmonic of beam betatron oscillation.

This paper reports on the commissioning and performance of a luminosity dither feedback. The system; based on one previously used at SLAC for PEP-II; is employed for collision orbit feedback in the horizontal plane. Twelve air-core Helmholtz coils drive the positron beam sinusoidally at a frequency near 80 Hz; forming a closed bump at the interaction point. A lock-in amplifier detects the amplitude and phase of the corresponding frequency component of the luminosity signal. When the beams are aligned for peak luminosity; the magnitude of the luminosity component at the dithering frequency becomes zero. The magnitude grows as the beams are offset; and the phase shifts by 180 degrees when the direction of the necessary correction reverses. The hardware and algorithm were tested during SuperKEKB Phase II run. The electron beam orbit was successfully adjusted to minimize the amplitude of the dither frequency component of the luminosity signal; and the optimal condition was maintained by continuously adjusting the electron beam orbit.",,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/tupc13_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/tupc13.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/tupc13_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-TUPC13,328

The resulting improvement in photon statistics makes possible single-bunch; single-turn measurements at lower bunch currents than are possible with a single pinhole or slit. In addition; the coded aperture pattern provides extra information for beam profile reconstruction; which makes possible somewhat improved resolution; as compared to a single slit. The reconstruction algorithm for coded aperture imaging is more complicated and computing-intensive than that for a single slit; though with certain classes of coded pertures a faster reconstruction method is possible.

Therefore it was decided for the European XFEL to measure transverse beam profiles based on scintillating screen monitors using LYSO:Ce. While it is possible to resolve beam sizes down to a few micrometers with this scintillator; the experience during the XFEL commissioning showed that the measured emittance values were significantly larger than the expected ones. In addition; beam profiles measured at bunch charges of a few hundred pC showed a ’smoke ring’ structure. While coherent OTR emission and beam dynamical influence can be excluded; it is assumed that the profile distortions are caused by effects from the scintillator material. Following the experience in high energy physics; a simple model was developed which takes into account quenching effects of excitonic carriers inside a scintillator in a heuristic way. Based on this model; the observed beam profiles can be understood qualitatively.

The storage-ring operation will be influenced by a transient beam-loading effect of all cavities and by the complex filling pattern due to the disparity in the current of long and short bunches. This; in turn; could introduce a variation of beam trajectory; transverse profile; and length for the different bunches. This stimulates the development of bunch-resolved monitors for bunch length; beam size; filling pattern and beam trajectory displacement.

ibic2018,,WEPA09,Long Term Beam Phase Monitoring Based on HOM Signals in SC Cavities at FLASH,USTC/NSRL; Hefei; Anhui; People’s Republic of China; DESY; Hamburg; Germany; PSI; Villigen PSI; Switzerland; The accelerating RF fields in superconducting cavities must be controlled precisely in FEL (Free Electron Laser) facilities to avoid beam energy spread and arrival time jitter. Otherwise the beam quality is degraded. The LLRF (Low Level Radio Frequency) system controls the RF field and provides a highly stable RF reference. A new type of beam phase determination technique based on beam-excited HOMs (Higher Order Modes) in cavities has been implemented. The two special couplers installed at both ends of each cavity; pick up the signals containing both the leakage of the accelerating field and the HOM signals. Therefore the signals can be used to calculate the beam phase directly with respect to the RF phase. We analysed the factors which may affect the result of the beam phase on a long-term based on an experimental platform at FLASH. Some phase drifts between the HOM-BPhM (Beam Phase Monitor) and the LLRF system phase measurement were observed and the reason will be further studied.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/wepa09_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/wepa09.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/wepa09_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-WEPA09,388

In many cases; the Kramers-Krönig relationship is used to reconstruct the temporal distribution of the beam from the coherent radiation spectrum. However; the extrapolation of the low frequency will introduce the uncertainty of the reconstruction. In this paper; an algorithm of differential evolution (DE) for temporal reconstruction is discussed. The DE reconstruction works well for the complex and ultrashort distribution.

When electron bunches go through an S-band monopole cavity; about 1 us long RF signal can be obtained to compare with a low phase noise RF reference.

Bunch lengthening with current was studied at BEP with its new RF-cavity. In addition the method of synchrotron frequency measurement by dissector was applied. After dissector checkouts at BEP the similar studies were carried out with a single beam at VEPP-2000 storage ring in parallel with streak-camera measurements. Good agreement of results was observed. Series of single-turn longitudinal and vertical bunch profiles snapshots was made by streak-camera with respect to delay after counter beam injection.

The minimum detectable beam size is affected by the diameter of a single wire. The smallest carbon or tungsten wires used so far have diameters of about 4 microns. With the development of modern electron accelerators and the demands from future linear electron-positron colliders; sub-micron beam sizes have to be resolved. In order to increase the resolution; the decrease of the wire diameter is required. The authors of Ref. * proposed to manufacture thin gold stripes of rectangular shape (widths are equal to 1 µm or 2 µm and height is equal to 3 µm) on Si3N4 membrane. We propose to use another arrangement of gold stripes with varying period on a Si substrate. A set of 11 stripes with 1 µm width and 10 micron height with varying gap width in the range 3-0.25 µm (""grating scanner"") was simulated by using an analytical model and by the Geant4 code. By moving this scanner across the beam one could measure the Bremsstrahlung yield vs. the coordinate; resulting in an oscillating dependence. The visibility of the resulting image allows defining the beam sizes in the range of 0.5-1.5 µm for the proposed scanner parameters.; * S.

In the image plane; the PSF has a typical lobe-shape distribution with an inter-peak distance depending on wavelength and lens aperture ratio [*]. For a beam with a transverse rms size smaller than the distance; the reconstruction of the beam profile has several difficulties [**; ***]. We propose to reduce the PSF contribution and to improve the spatial resolution of an OTR monitor simply by rotating the lens optical axis with respect to the specular reflection direction. If the difference between the rotational angle and the lens aperture is much larger than the inverse Lorentz factor; the PSF has a Gaussian-like distribution which matches practically with the Airy distribution. Thus the resolution depends on wavelength and lens aperture. In principle; for lens apertures in the order of 0.1 rad such an approach should allow to measure beam sizes comparable to the wavelength of observation; using a simple deconvolution procedure for the measured image and the PSF.; * M.

Both methods exploit the analysis of broadband electromagnetic radiation resulting from polarization currents produced in; or at the boundary of; a medium in close proximity of a charged particle beam. To increase the resolution of DR; measurements were performed in the UV range at a wavelength of 250 nm. With such configurations; sensitivity to the beam size of a 1.2 GeV electron beam below 10 um was observed at the Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) at KEK; Japan.

This monitor can track the passage of individual particles up to intensities of 107 particles per second per mm2; over an active area of 20 cm x 20 cm; and with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. Thanks to an external trigger system; the achieved detection efficiency is 95% and the noise level is kept below 10-4 events/second. The simple design of this monitor avoids the common production difficulties of scintillating fibre detectors and makes its maintenance easier; when compared to other tracking detectors; due to the absence of gas or cooling. Using special electronics; a version of the monitor can also be used for time-of-flight measurements; achieving a time resolution of 900 ps. Thanks to its versatility; the monitor will perform several functions when measuring the secondary beams of the CERN Neutrino Platform: beam profile; position and intensity measurement; magnetic momentum spectrometry; particle identification through time-of-flight; and trigger generation for the experiments.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/wepb15_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/wepb15.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/wepb15_poster.pdf,True,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-WEPB15,468

As improvements to the accelerator lattice reduce the beam emittance; e.g. with upgrades to fourth generation synchrotron light sources; likewise the beam size will be reduced such that micron and sub-micron scale resolution is required for beam size measurement. Therefore the spatial resolution of the pinhole camera imaging system must be improved accordingly.

An X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) based on the self-amplified spontaneous emission scheme is a newly developed ultrafast light source with femtosecond duration. The ultrafast XFEL pulses are generated from the electron bunches (e-bunches) that are accelerated to a relativistic speed with strong compression to a femtosecond regime. Evaluation of the temporal profile of the e-bunch is therefore essential for optimizing accelerator parameters for achieving XFEL amplification; as well as for characterizing the XFEL pulse duration. As a new temporal diagnostic scheme for e-bunches; we recently propose an X-ray intensity interferometry using spontaneous X-ray beam generated by the e-bunch [1].

Signals are sampled simultaneously by a multi-channel acquisition system with the same clock and trigger. Different data processing methods are used to extract the 6-dimensional information; where the delta-over-sum algorithm for beam position extraction; the Gaussian fitting algorithm for beam size extraction; zero-crossing detection algorithm for beam phase extraction and the two-frequency method for bunch length extraction. The system set up and performance will be discussed in more detail in this paper.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/thob01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/thob01.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/thob01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-THOB01,542
ibic2018,,THOB02,Energy Loss Measurements with Streak Camera at ALBA,A.A. Nosych; B. Bravo; U. Irisopresenter; ALBA-CELLS Synchrotron; Cerdanyola del Vallès; Spain; Analyzing streak camera images of the beam injected into a Storage Ring with no RF voltage allows calculating several parameters; like the energy loss per turn and the energy mismatch between injected and stored beams. These measurements are based on the analysis of the centroid drift path of a bunch as it spirals inwards; changing its rotation period. This drift is clear and measurable in single and multi-bunch modes in several horizontal sweep speeds of the streak. With this technique we also measure the momentum compaction factor and observe its change with respect to the insertion devices’ open/closed states. The obtained values are comparable with theoretical expectations; as well as with values measured by other means.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/thob02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/thob02.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/thob02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-THOB02,548
ibic2018,,THOB03,Long Term Investigation of the Degradation of Coaxial Cables,M. Kuntzsch; R. Schurig; HZDR; Dresden; Germany; Delta Gamma RF-Expert; Melbourne; Australia; el-spec GmbH; Geretsried; Germany,,For the transport of RF signals coaxial cables with PTFE (’Teflon’) as dielectric medium are widely used because they offer a wide bandwidth and low insertion loss. Coaxial cables that are routed in immediate vicinity to the beamline are exposed to ionizing radiation that is mainly generated by beam-loss. In this radiative environment cables change their electrical properties which directly affects the signal on the receiver side and in turn the measured beam parameters. This contribution describes a measurement setup at the superconducting CW accelerator ELBE that was used to investigate the degradation of coaxial cables under well-controlled conditions up to an accumulated dose of 94 kGy. Furthermore the acquired data up to 40 GHz of two coaxial cable samples are presented and the results are discussed.,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/talks/thob03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/papers/thob03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/ibic2018/posters/thob03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IBIC2018-THOB03,552
