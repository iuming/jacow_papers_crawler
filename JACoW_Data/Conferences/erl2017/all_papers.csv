(MHI); Takasago; Japan; MHI-MS; Kobe; Japan; KEK has been developing a superconducting RF gun for CW ERL since 2013. The SRF gun is a combination of a 1.3 GHz; 1.5-cell superconducting RF cavity and a backside excitation type photocathode. The photocathode consists of transparent substrate MgAl2O4; transparent superconductor LiTi2O4 and bi-alkali photocathode K2CsSb. The reason for using transparent superconductor is to reflect RF by using the feature of penetration depth of superconductor; which is defined from London equation. It protects optical components from RF damage. The critical DC magnetic field of the cathode; quantum efficiency and initial emittance were measured. These show the cathode can be used for the SRF gun. The gun cavity was designed to satisfy the photocathode operation. Eight vertical tests of the gun cavity have been performed. The surface peak electric field reaches to 75 MV/m with the dummy cathode rod which was made of bulk niobium.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/moiacc002_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/moiacc002.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/moiacc002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOIACC002,1

At Johannes Gutenberg-Universität we are able to measure the longitudinal pulse responses of different photocathodes: negative electron affinity (NEA) types and positive electron affinity (PEA) types. With NEA (Cs:GaAs); the pulse response depends on the wavelength of photoexcitation and show at 800nm a long and relatively intense tail whereas at 400nm a similar shape but with orders of magnitude lower intensity is observed. In comparison to this distribution; PEA pulse responses (K2CsSb) show a similar shape as well but another order of magnitude less intensity than NEA in the blue excitation.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/moibcc002_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/moibcc002.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/moibcc002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOIBCC002,
erl2017,,MOIBCC003,Semiconductor Photocathode Development for the BERLinPro SRF Photoinjector,HZB; Berlin; Germany; At HZB an ERL type accelerator; called BERLinPro; is being built. Cs-K-Sb photocathodes have been identified as electron source for low emittance and high current operation (100 mA). At the moment; the SRF-photoinjector for BERLinPro with an extensive diagnostics beam line is in the commissioning phase; which will also serve as a testbed to assess the performance of in-house produced Cs-K-Sb photocathodes. The deposition of Sb; K and Cs in order to prepare Cs-K-Sb photocathodes is demanding and requests an ultra-high vacuum. Even marginal changes to the process may influence the spectral quantum efficiency; the emittance and the lifetime of the photocathode; and hence change the characteristics of the electron bunch in the SRF-photoinjector. In my talk I will present the latest results of our photocathode research and I will give an update on the status of the SRF-photoinjector and BERLinPro.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/moibcc003_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/moibcc003.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/moibcc003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOIBCC003,

There has been considerable interest in developing suitable cathodes for 24/7 operation under such stringent conditions. Recently; at BNL; we have fabricated cathodes with QE in the range of 10% for Cs-K-Sb cathodes and 5% for Na-K-Sb cathodes when irradiated with 532 nm laser and a single pulse charge up to 5 nC in the SRF gun has been produced. In this presentation; we discuss the fabrication of Cs-K-Sb and Na-K-Sb cathodes using both dispensers and effusion cells as sources of alkali metal; characterization of these cathodes; transporting them from the fabrication location to the RHIC tunnel under UHV conditions and installation in the electron guns in the tunnel.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/moibcc004_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/moibcc004.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/moibcc004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOIBCC004,

Coaxial couplers are widely used due to multiple merits; such as compactness; easy fabrication; less heat leak; easy to compress multipacting; etc.. However; the coaxial couplers also encounter cooling and power handling problems at high power transmission scenarios.

The 1.3 GHz superconducting cavities are used in the injector linac cryomodule and the main linac cryomodule. The slide-jack tuner with stepper motor is used for coarse tuning of the resonant frequency; and piezo tuner is used for fine tuning. The digital tuner feedback system based on micro-TCA standard has been employed. The frequency band of the tuner feedback has been set lower than the mechanical resonance frequency. The rf field fluctuation caused by the Michrophonics is compensated by the rf feedback. In the injector linac; one rf source drives two cavities with vector-sum control. The vector-sum calibration error affected the beam energy jitter; but that has been improved after adopting the high gain parameter in resonant frequency feedback in order to keep the field balance of the cavities.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/moiccc003_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/moiccc003.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/moiccc003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOICCC003,

The intention for this upgrade was to reach higher beam energy; higher bunch charge and lower emittance at the same time in order to serve user experiments at the superconducting CW accelerator ELBE. In our contribution we will report on the commissioning of the SRF gun by presenting a full set of RF performance results as well as detailed beam parameter measurements up to a bunch charge of 300 pC. Additionally; we will present the results of the first two user experiments (neutron and THz generation) that demonstrated the reliability of this gun concept.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp003_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp003.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp003_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP003,

In particular for the case of RF-sources the investigation of the time response is of great importance. In Mainz we are able to synthesize these kinds of photocathodes and investigate their pulse response at 1 picosecond level using a radio frequency streak method. We present on the one hand the cathode plant which is used for synthesizing the multi alkali antimonide photocathodes and on the other hand first measurements showing pulse responses of K2CsSb at 400 nm laser wavelength. Furthermore; an analyzing chamber has been installed; which allows investigation of lifetime under laser heating and in-situ measurements of the work function using a UHV Kelvin Probe.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp004_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP004,4

Due to its triode inspired design the extraction gradient can be reduced for e.g. investigations of cathode physics; but also enhanced to mitigate space charge effects. In the framework of the MESA-Project (Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator) its design has been further optimized to cope with space charge dominated electron beams. Although it injects its electron beams directly into the LEBT matching section; which excludes any adjustments of the electron spin; the source SPOCK will allow higher bunch charges than the MESA standard source.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp006_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp006.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp006_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP006,13
erl2017,,MOPSPP007,Beam Dynamics and Collimation Following MAGIX at MESA,B. Ledroit; K. Aulenbacher; IKP; Mainz; Germany; The Mainz Energy-recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) will be an electron accelerator allowing operation in energy-recovery linac (ERL) mode. After the beam hits the target at the MESA Internal Gas Target Experiment (MAGIX); the beam is phase shifted and recirculated back into the linac sections. These will transfer the kinetic beam energy back to the RF-field by deceleration of the beam and allow for high beam power with low RF-power input. Since most of the beam does not interact with the target; the beam will mostly just pass the target untouched. However; a fraction of the scattered electrons may be in the range outside the accelerator and detector acceptances and therefore cause malicious beam dynamical behavior in the linac sections or even damage to the machine. The goal of this work is to determine the beam behavior upon target passage by simulation and experiment and to protect the machine with a suitable collimation system. The present status of the investigations is presented.,,reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp007_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp007.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp007_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP007,17

Here the spin manipulation and the bunch preparation for the injector accelerator take place. Due to the low energy; space charge will be an challenging issue in this part. Therefore; start-to-end simulations were done with a combination of the two particle dynamics codes PARMELA* and CST**. At the moment; a test setup is being built up to check the functionality of devices and compare the beam parameters with the simulation. Here the focus lies on the bunch preparation system because at this part we expect high impact of the space charge by reason of the necessary bunch compression.

It will be operated in two different modes: the first is the external beam (EB) mode; where the beam is dumped after being used at the experiment. The required beam current in EB mode is 150 µA with polarized electrons at 155 MeV. In the second operation mode MESA will be run as an energy recovery linac (ERL) with an unpolarized beam of 1 mA at 105 MeV. In a later construction stage of MESA the achievable beam current in ERL-mode shall be upgraded to 10 mA.

We propose to test an advanced scheme of resonantly exciting coherent diffraction radiation in an optical cavity. By stimulating the radiation in a multi-bunch beam; highly enhanced radiation power can be extracted.

In the case of high current beam operation; the ions generated by collision of the beam and the residual molecules on the beam axis is increase and its flow back to the electron gun. As a result; the quantum efficiency (QE) of the photocathode decreases due to ion bombardment is the main factor of determining the cathode lifetime. After the CW operation of the accumulated extracted charge of ~10 Coulomb; steady decrease in QE due to ion bombardment has not yet been clearly confirmed. In order to analyze the area damaged by ion bombard; 2D QE distribution (QE map) measurement system was newly installed in the cathode preparation system. From QE map analysis before and after the CW operation; we confirmed two types of QE decrease. The area about 2 mm diameter near the center of the photocathode that the QE recovery is insufficient by the reactivation process is presumed the damage by ion bombardment.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp012.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP012,

ILC utilizes it for the positron source and the two boosters for the 5-GeV damping ring. The conventional positron source; which is based on a collision of the multi-GeV electron with the target; was chosen to lengthen the macro-pulse duration for avoiding the heat loading. In this proposal; the CW linac realizes the long macro-pulse duration beam operation of the positron beam as well as the electron for collision with the target. Simultaneously; the CW linac can used as the 5-GeV booster of the polarized electron beam at the same bunch pattern. Because of the low average current of beams of ILC; the CW linac have enough ability to accelerate/decelerate the high quality electron beam for the high brilliant X-ray light source such as 6-GeV class ERL light source and XFELO. Each electron beam has different injection energy; injects at the different merger and accelerates at the different RF phase. Therefore; the electron energies are different at the end of the CW linac and it makes the simultaneous operation possible.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp013.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP013,

The high voltage (HV) DC-gun that realized acceleration voltage of > 500 kV and electric field of > 5 MV/m is one of the candidates. In order to stably DC-gun operation; the HV conditioning process is an essential step as preparation of DC-gun operation. The HV conditioning was carried out on compact-ERL (cERL) electron gun and clarified the following four points. i) The voltage at which discharge stops (discharge stop voltage) exists; ii) The discharge stop voltage increases almost continuously with the number of discharges; iii) The gas released at the occurrence of discharge is almost proportional to the difference between the discharge start voltage and the discharge stop voltage; iv) The hold-off time of the voltage is very long under the discharge stop voltage. We focused on the electron stimulated desorption (ESD) phenomenon occurring at the anode can explain these phenomena in a consistent and considered the mechanism of discharge generation in DC field and HV conditioning progression in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV).; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,N. Nishimoripresenter N. Nishimoripresenter reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/mopspp016_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/mopspp016.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/mopspp016_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-MOPSPP016,

erl2017,,MOIDCC001,Update on the KEK ERL Test Facility (cERL),KEK; Ibaraki; Japan; The test facility of Compact ERL (cERL) was constructed to develop critical accelerator components for future light sources. The target of cERL is to realize the ERL operation under the conditions of low emittance (lower than 1 mm mrad) with high current (averaged current of 10 mA). Our group presented the construction and initial commissioning result at the previous ERL15 workshop. After that; we have made an effort to update the performance; so that we have succeeded the ERL operation under the conditions of beam current of 1mA with lower emittance of 1mm mrad. At the bunch charges of 0.5 pC and 7.7 pC; the beam emittance was demonstrated at the March of 2016 as 0.3 mm mrad and 1-1.8 mm mrad; respectively. We also achieved the stable beam operation at the conditions of 1mA with 162.5 MHz with a small beam loss; so that it is expected to be possible to operate 10 mA at cERL with a present radiation shielding geometry. Furthermore; recently; we have made an effort to realize the beam development under high bunch charge (40 pC/bunch) operation.

This includes a DC electron source and an SRF injector Linac with world-record current and normalized brightness in a bunch train; a high-current linac cryomodule; and a high-power beam stop; and several diagnostics tools for high-current and high-brightness beams. All these are now being used to construct a novel one-cryomodule ERL in Cornell's Wilson Lab. BNL has designed a multi-turn ERL for eRHIC; where beam is transported more than 20 times around the 4km long RHIC tunnel. The number of transport lines is minimized by using two arcs with strongly-focusing permanent magnets that can control many beams of different energies. A collaboration between BNL and Cornell has been formed to investigate this multi-turn eRHIC ERL design by building a 4-turn; one-cryomodule ERL at Cornell. It also has a return loop built with strongly focusing permanent magnets and is meant to accelerate 40 mA beam to 150 MeV.

The purpose of the run was to mimic an internal gas target for DarkLight* - an experiment designed to search for a dark matter particle. The ERL was not run again until late 2015 for a brief re-commissioning in preparation for the next phase of DarkLight. In the intervening years; the FEL was rebranded as the Low Energy Recirculator Facility (LERF); while organizationally the FEL division was absorbed into the Accelerator division. In 2016 several weeks of operation were allocated to configure the machine for Darklight with the purpose of exercising - for the first time - an internal gas target in an ERL.

Another requirement to such radiators is high wall plug efficiency. The efficiency is usually very low and the electron beam energy recovery is the most attractive way to improve it. This is normally done using SCRF ERL systems but the bunch current limitations for these systems are more dramatic when compared with a conventional LINACs. Increase of the bunch current in conventional ERLs above some threshold value (normally around 100 mA) leads to beam instabilities development and beam transportation termination. This naturally limits the instruments' luminosity. Here we suggest and discuss the novel concept and specific designs which can enable a SCRF ERL system capable of generating picosecond electron bunches with up to 1A current. The aim of the project is to demonstrate the operation of dual axis asymmetric ERL and its application in research and industry.

Instead of having four separate return loops to the linac; it instead has a single fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) beamline with nearly a factor of 4 energy acceptance. While ideally the FFAG would be circular with identical cells all around; space and cost considerations dictate that small radius of curvature FFAGs should be used near the linac; connected by a straight beamline. To ensure good orbit matching over the entire energy range; adiabatic transitions are inserted between the arcs and the straight. After briefly introducing basic principles of FFAG optics; we describe how we choose the parameters of the arc cell; the basic building block of the lattice. We then describe how the straight cell is chosen to work well with the arc. Finally we describe the design process for the transition that ensures orbits over the entire energy range end up very close to the axis of the straight. We discuss how the realization of this lattice design with physical magnets impacts the design process.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/tuidcc004_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/tuidcc004.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/tuidcc004_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-TUIDCC004,52

However as beam brightness increases so too do the effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and the microbunching instability. The Low Energy Recirculator Facility at Jefferson Laboratory provides a test bed to characterize aspects of CSR's effect on the beam by measuring the energy extraction via CSR as a function of bunch compression. Data was recorded with acceleration occuring on the rising part of the RF waveform while the full compression point was moved along the backleg of the machine and the response of the beam measured. Acceleration was moved to the falling part of the RF waveform and the experiment repeated. Initial start-to-end simulations using a 1D CSR model show good agreement with measurements. The experiment motivated the design of a modified Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility style arc with control of CSR and the microbunching gain. Insights gained from that study informed designs for recirculation arcs in an ERL-driven electron cooler for Jefferson Laboratory's Electron Ion Collider.

The results of tracking simulations to model these effects in BERLinPro are discussed.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/thiacc002_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/thiacc002.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/thiacc002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-THIACC002,

After the success of the initial MLC test; the MLC has been moved into the final location for the initial beam test into the MLC. The levels of microphonic in the MLC cavities without fast tuner compensation were measured at the initial and the final location; confirming that these should not limit the CBETA requirement of a nominal energy gain of 36 MeV per pass. Nevertheless; a further reduction of microphonics is desirable for improved energy stability and reduced RF power demand. The cryogenic gas line to the MLC was optimized to reduce vibrations. A piezoelectric-driven fast tuner is installed on each MLC cavity; and its usefulness in compensating cavity microphonics was studied. Here we report details from these tests and summarize results.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/thibcc002_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/thibcc002.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/thibcc002_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-THIBCC002,

A systematic beam halo study was established at the KEK Compact ERL (cERL) since machine commissioning in spring 2015 in order to understand the beam halo formation and to have the stable and safe operation. The results of halo simulations have given a reasonable explanation of the low bunch charge (0.2-0.3 pC) beam profiles evaluated during the measurement. Thus; vertical beam halos observed at cERL are supposed to be due to the longitudinal bunch tails transferred into the transverse plane. Tails are mainly produced by the cathode response on the laser excitation. Further; when a beam passing the rf cavity off-center it experiences rf field kicks. The beam tilt could be a complex effect of the steering coils and cavities misalignments. During spring 2017 commissioning the bunch charge was increased up to 40 pC. In present study we are challenging to describe how the space charge effect acts on the beam halo profiles; and how the halo formation mechanisms change in this connection.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/talks/thiccc001_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/papers/thiccc001.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/erl2017/posters/thiccc001_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-ERL2017-THICCC001,
