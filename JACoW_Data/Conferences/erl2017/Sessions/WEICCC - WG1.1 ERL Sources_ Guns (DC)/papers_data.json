        "Beam commissioning of the compact ERL (cERL) has been performed for the next generation ERL light sources such as a laser Compton gamma-ray source and a high power FEL for EUV lithography. The operational high voltage of the cERL DC gun has been limited to 390 kV due to failure of the ten segmented insulators. In November 2015",
        "we installed an additional two segmented insulators on the top of the existing ten segmented insulators. In December 2015",
        "we successfully performed high voltage conditioning up to 500 kV. We also found high voltage threshold for stable operation in a dc electron gun [1]. The cERL operational voltage has been 450 kV in maximum since then. We will present details of the high voltage upgrade and operational status at 450 kV of the cERL gun.",
