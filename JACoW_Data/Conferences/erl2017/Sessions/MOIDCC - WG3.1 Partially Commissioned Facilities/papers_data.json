        "The test facility of Compact ERL (cERL) was constructed to develop critical accelerator components for future light sources. The target of cERL is to realize the ERL operation under the conditions of low emittance (lower than 1 mm mrad) with high current (averaged current of 10 mA). Our group presented the construction and initial commissioning result at the previous ERL15 workshop. After that",
        "we have made an effort to update the performance",
        "so that we have succeeded the ERL operation under the conditions of beam current of 1mA with lower emittance of 1mm mrad. At the bunch charges of 0.5 pC and 7.7 pC",
        "the beam emittance was demonstrated at the March of 2016 as 0.3 mm mrad and 1-1.8 mm mrad",
        "respectively. We also achieved the stable beam operation at the conditions of 1mA with 162.5 MHz with a small beam loss",
        "so that it is expected to be possible to operate 10 mA at cERL with a present radiation shielding geometry. Furthermore",
        "recently",
        "we have made an effort to realize the beam development under high bunch charge (40 pC/bunch) operation. I will present these updated developments from the previous ERL15 workshop."
