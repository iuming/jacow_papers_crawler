        "KEK has been developing a superconducting RF gun for CW ERL since 2013. The SRF gun is a combination of a 1.3 GHz",
        "1.5-cell superconducting RF cavity and a backside excitation type photocathode. The photocathode consists of transparent substrate MgAl2O4",
        "transparent superconductor LiTi2O4 and bi-alkali photocathode K2CsSb. The reason for using transparent superconductor is to reflect RF by using the feature of penetration depth of superconductor",
        "which is defined from London equation. It protects optical components from RF damage. The critical DC magnetic field of the cathode",
        "quantum efficiency and initial emittance were measured. These show the cathode can be used for the SRF gun. The gun cavity was designed to satisfy the photocathode operation. Eight vertical tests of the gun cavity have been performed. The surface peak electric field reaches to 75 MV/m with the dummy cathode rod which was made of bulk niobium."
