        "For high average electron beam currents the length of the electron bunches must match the acceptance of the accelerator. At Johannes Gutenberg-Universität we are able to measure the longitudinal pulse responses of different photocathodes: negative electron affinity (NEA) types and positive electron affinity (PEA) types. With NEA (Cs:GaAs)",
        "the pulse response depends on the wavelength of photoexcitation and show at 800nm a long and relatively intense tail whereas at 400nm a similar shape but with orders of magnitude lower intensity is observed. In comparison to this distribution",
        "PEA pulse responses (K2CsSb) show a similar shape as well but another order of magnitude less intensity than NEA in the blue excitation."
