      "abstract": "The LHeC is envisioned as a natural upgrade of the LHC that aims at delivering an electron beam for collisions with the existing hadronic beams. The current baseline design for the electron facility consists of a multipass superconducting energy-recovery linac (ERL) operating in a continuous wave mode and delivering a beam current up to 25 mA at the energy of 60 GeV. This contribution aims at briefly reviewing the beam dynamics aspects motivating the existing design choices. Emphasis will be put in the open issues with their potential synergies with other projects.",

        "One attractive feature of energy recovery linacs (ERLs) is they are source limited. However as beam brightness increases so too do the effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and the microbunching instability. The Low Energy Recirculator Facility at Jefferson Laboratory provides a test bed to characterize aspects of CSR's effect on the beam by measuring the energy extraction via CSR as a function of bunch compression. Data was recorded with acceleration occuring on the rising part of the RF waveform while the full compression point was moved along the backleg of the machine and the response of the beam measured. Acceleration was moved to the falling part of the RF waveform and the experiment repeated. Initial start-to-end simulations using a 1D CSR model show good agreement with measurements. The experiment motivated the design of a modified Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility style arc with control of CSR and the microbunching gain. Insights gained from that study informed designs for recirculation arcs in an ERL-driven electron cooler for Jefferson Laboratory's Electron Ion Collider. Progress on the design and outstanding challenges of the cooler are discussed."
