Accelerating structure, injection system and focusing system are improved. Previously observed second emission resonant discharge - multipactor is suppressed by increasing the field amplitude in the structure first cavity and using the protector. The parameters of the accelerated beam close to the design ones, i.e. electron energy up to 8 MeV, capture to the acceleration mode up to 100%, were received. Capture is provided by the RF electron focusing of the microwave field structure with usage of the magnetic focusing system based on permanent magnets and RF grid control in the electron gun. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-",

In this paper Maxwell equations are used for beam-cavity interaction analysis. The bunch energy loss or the same the voltage induced by radiating bunch is expressed in terms of cavity external parameters.

Control functions representing geometry of the electrodes and a quality functional describing the beam are introduced. To solve the problem numerically these control functions are parametrized. The presented method is based on the computation of the derivatives of the first and the second order of the quality functional on the parameters. Results of investigation of efficiency of the method relatively to a method including computation of the derivatives only of the first order are presented. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-",

Usually vane voltage for protons must be two times less than vane voltage for deuterons. If space charge is significant vane voltage for protons can be too small to reach high efficiency of bunching and focusing of protons beam. It is shown that a rising of voltage up to nominal value for deuterons leads to increasing of capture and transmission for protons. Another problem is concerned with a choice of radial matching section parameters",

      "abstract": "Differential-difference equations with time delay are often used in mathematical models describing the dynamics of beams of the charged particles. For example linear equation of the second order with a constant time delay describes in the smoothed approach dynamics of a beam of the charged particles in synchrotrons with a feedback system. However the time delay cannot always be considered constant. The time proportional delay can occur at acceleration of beams of the charged particles in the cyclotron. It should be noted that such time delay is unbounded and well known approaches are not applicable for stability analysis such systems. The stabilizing control for the system of linear equations could be constructed by the information on a state vector of the system. Sometimes the state vector is unknown but we know some linear combinations of its components. Then there is a problem on construction of the stabilizing control with incomplete information. In this paper we investigate a possibility of stabilization of system of linear equations with time proportional delay by the linear observation. Using the sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability of system of linear equations with linear increasing delay we obtain some conditions of existence of the asymptotic evaluation system of the original system. Then we use the asymptotic evaluation system for the construction of the stabilizing control and derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of such control. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-",

Interference switch is based on series of H-plane T-junctions (cascade switch) in the view of decreasing switched power at Off state and comprises irises in both its own input and output arms. At On state the irises act as a transmission resonator localizing the nodes of the standing wave at the junctions. Such distribution is expected to decrease the plasma losses. It was shown with a simulation that the cascade switch with additional irises increases the efficiency of the active microwave compressors. The simulation was made with CST studio and COMSOL. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-",

To get an appropriate coupling with the slow-wave structure a coaxial coupler design is considered. Reduction of reflected harmonic and coupler matching is performed by end-cell geometry modification.

The multipactor appears only with the secondaty emission yield (SEY) growth which could happen if the inner surface of the cavity is polluted.

The analytical estimation and numerical simulation of multipactor in CDS INR structure shows the appearance of the discharge in coupling cells with the OFC copper SEY for the operating regime of the cavity. An option for the multipactor damping with the forced excitation of oscillations in coupling cell with voltage higher than upper multipactor limit was considered."

        "The proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration is a recently proposed technique promising a GeV/m rate of acceleration to a TeV-scale energy in a single plasma stage. In order to excite high-amplitude plasma wakefields a long proton bunch from a synchrotron should be broken into a sequence of sub-mm long micro-bunches which can drive the plasma oscillations resonantly. We suggest a novel approach to produce the required train of micro-bunches using collinear wakefield acceleration in a dielectric-loaded structures. First the energy modulation is introduced into the proton beam with the help of the mm-wavelength dielectric accelerating structure. Then the energy modulation is transformed into the longitudinal micro-bunching using proton beamline with magnetic dipoles. Beam dynamics simulations were used to find the appropriate parameters of the dielectric accelerating structure",

Rectangular dielectric structures are used both in proof of principle experiments for new accelerating schemes and for studying the electronic properties of the structure loading material. Some of the materials used for the waveguide loading of accelerating structures possess significant anisotropic properties. General solutions for the fields generated by a relativistic electron beam propagating in a rectangular dielectric waveguide have been derived using the mode expansion method for the transverse operators of the Helmholtz equation. An expression for the combined Cherenkov and Coulomb fields obtained in terms of a superposition of LSM and LSE-modes of rectangular waveguide with anisotropic dielectric loading has been obtained. Numerical modeling of the longitudinal and transverse (deflecting) wakefields has been carried out. It is shown that the dielectric anisotropy influences to excitation parameters of the dielectric-lined waveguide with the anisotropic loading.",

One of the ways to get bright x-ray source based on crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms is to run the electrons in coherent radiation regime based on self amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). In the present contribution we will discuss under which conditions the SASE can start in the case of crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms. To investigate the initial stage of SASE process we use the first-order perturbation theory that enables to describe the collective beam response as effective susceptibility.

A three-dimensional (3D)simulation code IBSimu has been utilized for modeling of the transport and matching system of beam from the H-minus ion source into RFQ. A magnetic low energy beam transport (LEBT) line consisting of two solenoids and LEBT consisting of six magnetic quadrupole lenses were analyzed. The particle data from the 50 mA 100 keV ion beam extraction system simulations were taken as the starting data for the LEBT simulations. The main objective of the project was to achieve the required Twiss parameters and to minimize emittance growth at RFQ entrance. The LEBT consisting of two solenoids is more convenient in adjustment and as simulation results have shown this system offers more acceptable beam characteristics at the match point in comparison with LEBT composed of quadrupole lenses. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-",

        "which is analyzed and compared for different operating frequencies and different RF pulse length. Both general dependencies and particularities are considered. Some recommendations for practical choice of the RF probe are presented."

The unique property to generate high potential without external high voltage power supply can be used to develop compact electron and ion accelerators with particles energies up to several hundred keV for different applications. We have developed the laboratory experimental setup for exciting d-d nuclear fusion by pyroelectric crystal LiTaO3. The setup allows to provide and control the neutrons generated during d-d nuclear fusion. It is shown that the neutrons with energy 2.45 MeV can be generated starting from a level of electric potential generated by pyroelectric crystal about 30 kV",
