        "The conception of Multi-purpose Hadrons Facility (MHF) began to be discussed at ITEP in the late ~2010s when ITEP-TWAC facility was intensively exploited for physical and applied research with the use of accelerated proton and ion beams varied in a wide range of operating parameters. Technological developments have continued to expand the scope of beams utilizing in diverse fields of science",
