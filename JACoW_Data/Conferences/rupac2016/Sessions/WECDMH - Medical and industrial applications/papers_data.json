      "abstract": "We present the results of the commissioning of the pulsed linear electron accelerator with beam energy of 10 MeV, developed with the participation of scientists and engineers of the SINP MSU, LEA MSU Ltd. and JSC \"RPE \"Toriy\". The source of RF power for accelerator is a multibeam klystron KIU-147A operating at 2856 MHz with pulse output power 6 MW and an average power of 25 kW. As a result of commissioning we received at the output of accelerator scanning system an electron beam with an energy of 10 MeV and an average power of more than 15 kW. Capture ratio and electronic efficiency of 1.24 m long accelerating structure are greater than 65%.",

        "was successfully commissioned and routinely used. Since then",
        "plenty of efforts were spent for upgrade of beamlines and elaboration of new methods of high energy heavy ion beam parameters evaluation and control under the SEE testing. The current status of the facility",

This shall extend characteristics of the National measurement standard to be used for calibration of a space monitoring equipment",
