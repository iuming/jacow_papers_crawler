The center consists of two protons and one neutron stands for test facilities developed at the PNPI in collaboration with the ROSCOSMOS Interagency Testing Center. The PNPI center is equipped with all necessary systems of diagnostics and monitoring of a beam",

Presently the work is in progress for external proton beam adjustment. The main goal of the C-80 is production of medical radionuclides for diagnostics and therapy. This cyclotron is also intended for treatment of ophthalmologic diseases by irradiation of malignant eye formation.

However medics from MGH (Boston) suggested alternative concept which leads to decrease both cost and size of the facility*. The concept is based on the following provisions: - immovable isocenter; - active scanning of a target volume; - different positions of patients at different fractions: - using CT on the place of irradiation after each change of positions of the patient for improvement plan; - using small change direction of the beam (like ±100). The \"Planar isocentric system\" developed by author can be used to enlarge the flexibility of the concept**. It's relatively chip",
