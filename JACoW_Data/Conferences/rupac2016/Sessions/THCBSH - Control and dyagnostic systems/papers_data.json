      "abstract": "Instruments for bunch shape and beam cross-section diagnostics at ion linacs are as important as complicated devices. Widespread Bunch Shape Monitors developed in INR RAS are used during a linac commissioning and optimization of beam dynamics. Beam Cross-Section Monitors implemented at INR RAS linac provide efficient non-destructive beam tuning and control. Features of both monitors investigated in simulations and beam tests are described. A variety of experimental results are presented.",
