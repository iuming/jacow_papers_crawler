        "Superconducting undulator with use of neutral poles was proposed in Budker INP. Period of the undulator is 15.6 mm. Pole gap and magnetic field are equal to 8 mm and 1.2 T correspondingly. A prototype of the undulator with 15 periods was fabricated and successfully tested. Calculations",
        "design and test results of the prototype in the report are presented. The cryogenic and vacuum system of the undulator are discussed."

        "Continuous wave (CW) 100 mA electron RF gun for injecting the high-quality 300-400 keV electron beam in Novosibirsk microtron recuperator (ERL) and driving Free Electron Laser (FEL) was developed",
        "built",
        "and commissioned at BINP SB RAS. The RF gun consists of normal conducting 90 MHz RF cavity with a gridded thermionic cathode unit. Bench tests of rf gun is confirmed good results in strict accordance with the calculations. The gun was tested up to the design specifications at a test bench that includes a diagnostics beam line. The rf gun stand testing showed reliable work",
        "unpretentious for vacuum conditions and stable in long-term operation. The design features of different components of the gun are presented. Preparation and commissioning experience is discussed. The beam test results are summarized."
