rupac2016,,MOYMH01,Experimental Approach to the Synthesis of Exotic Nuclei Using Heavy Ion Accelerators,JINR/FLNR; Moscow region; Russia; Speaking of exotic nuclei; we have in mind nuclei with ratios of proton to neutron numbers significantly differing from those of nuclei lying at the beta-stability valley; nuclei existing only due to stabilizing effects of nuclear shells; nuclei having unusual form or nucleon density distribution. The study of exotic nuclei provides excellent possibilities for testing models of nuclear forces and structure; reaction mechanisms and astrophysical processes. For producing exotic nuclei; different types of reactions induced by heavy ions are used: direct reactions - Coulomb excitation; nucleon transfer and spallation reactions; fragmentation of target and projectile nuclei; heavy ion induced fission and complete fusion reactions. To induce reactions ions with energy from n*MeV up to n*GeV; in the full accessible range of atomic numbers and masses are used. Secondary beams of exotic nuclei employed for producing of even more exotic species. For isolation of reaction products from primary beam on-line electromagnetic fragment separators; electrostatic separators; velocity selectors and gas-filled set-ups equipped with sophisticated detection systems find application. For producing secondary beams; IGISOL technique is effective in several cases. Special attention is payed to synthesis of super heavy nuclei. Over the past decade; numerous isotopes of super heavy elements with Z=112-118 have been produced in complete fusion reactions of accelerated 48Ca ions with actinide targets.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/moymh01_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/moymh01.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/moymh01_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-MOYMH01,
rupac2016,,MOYMH02,Physics Basis for the AWAKE Experiment,BINP SB RAS; Novosibirsk; Russia; AWAKE; an Advanced Wakefield Experiment at CERN aims at the first experimental demonstration of plasma wakefield acceleration driven by a high-energy proton beam. The proton beam must be sliced into the train of short micro-bunches in the plasma by a controllable beam-plasma instability. The self-modulated proton beam then excites the plasma wave; by which a bunch of externally injected electrons is trapped and accelerated. The acceleration scenario relies on several key effects; which thus far were observed in numerical simulations only. Their experimental proof will be an important step toward using proton beams for generation of high-energy; accelerator-quality lepton beams.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/moymh02_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/moymh02.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/moymh02_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-MOYMH02,
rupac2016,,MOYMH03,The MICE Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment: Progress and First Results,Imperial College of Science and Technology; Department of Physics; London; United Kingdom; The Muon Ionisation Cooling experiment (MICE) is designed to demonstrate the reduction of the phase-space volume occupied by a muon beam using the ionization-cooling technique; for the first time. This demonstration will be an important step in establishing the feasibility of muon accelerators for particle physics. The emittance of the beam is reduced through ionization as it passes through a cooling cell (or absorber) and is measured before and after the cooling cell using two high-precision scintillating-fibre tracking detectors (Trackers). Each Tracker is immersed in a uniform magnetic field produced by solenoidal spectrometers. The Trackers combined with a suite of other detectors perform the particle identification measurements. MICE is is now taking data at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. The design; hardware; status and first results from the MICE experiment are presented here.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/moymh03_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/moymh03.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/moymh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-MOYMH03,

rupac2016,,MOZMH03,Search for the Charged Particle Electric Dipole Moments in Storage Rings,FZJ; Jülich; Germany; The idea of searching for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of proton and deuteron using polarized beams in a storage ring was originally proposed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL); USA. Currently; the Jülich Electric Dipole moment Investigations (JEDI) collaboration develops the conceptual design of such a ring specifically for the search of the deuteron electrical dipole moment (dEDM). The idea is that the oscillation of the spin due to a possible finite electric dipole moment is separated from the influence of the magnetic dipole moment (MDM); and the spin behavior indicates the existence of dEDM. In connection with this problem; two questions arise: (i) how to create conditions for maximum growth of the total EDM signal of all particles in the beam bunch; and (ii) how to differentiate the EDM signal from the induced MDM signal. For the design of such a ring; we need to address three major challenges: - the ring lattice should meet the conditions of beam stability; and it has to have incorporated straight sections to accommodate the accelerating station; equipment for injection and extraction of the beam; a polarimeter; and sextupoles; - the polarization lifetime of the beam must be around ~1000 seconds; - systematic errors have to be minimized to eliminate the induced fake EDM signal. In my contribution; I will present the current status of the project.,,,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/mozmh03_talk.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/mozmh03.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/mozmh03_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-MOZMH03,6

The concept is based on the following provisions: - immovable isocenter; - active scanning of a target volume; - different positions of patients at different fractions: - using CT on the place of irradiation after each change of positions of the patient for improvement plan; - using small change direction of the beam (like ±100).

Many facilities use rotatable gantry beamlines to direct the proton or ion-beam at the patient from different angles. A key issue is the need to make future gantries lighter and more compact with the use of cryogen-free superconducting magnets; in particular for the final bending section which can be of large aperture. Benefits of using the superconducting technology are: (1) the possibility to have a large momentum acceptance; hence reducing the need to ramp the magnet and enabling new treatment techniques; (2) the size reduction due to a lower bend radius and (3) the weight reduction up to a factor ten. The latter will also significantly reduce the costs of the supporting structure. We present a conceptual design based on Nb3Sn superconducting combined function magnets (dipole; quadrupole; sextupole). The geometry using racetracks; the superconducting strand and cable parameters and the results of the thermal and the mechanical studies are reported.

It provides a selective destruction of tumor cells by prior accumulation of a stable boron-10 isotope inside them and subsequent irradiation with epithermal neutrons. It is expected that accelerator based neutron sources will be created for the clinical practice. One such source could be an original source of epithermal neutrons**; created in BINP. To obtain proton beam a new type of particle accelerator is used - tandem accelerator with vacuum insulation. Generation of neutrons is carried out as a result of the threshold reaction 7Li(p; n)7Be. During 2015-2016 in the construction of tandem accelerator with vacuum insulation several changes were made. This allowed us to suppress the unwanted flow of charged particles in the accelerator; to improve its high-voltage stability; and to increase the proton beam current from 1.6 to 5 mA. Such current value is sufficient for BNCT. The report describes in detail the modernization of the accelerator; presents and discusses the results of experiments on obtaining the proton beam and the formation of neutron flux using lithium target; and declares our prospective plans. The obtained neutron beam meets the requirements of BNCT: the irradiation of cell cultures provides the destruction of cells with boron and preservation of cells without boron.

Wide opportunities can be provided by new generation high power DRD and FID switches produced by JSC ""FID Technology"". The company has developed kicker HVG for accelerators with 1-5kV amplitude; 5-50ns pulse duration and PRF up to 5MHz. Rise time can be 1-2ns and fall time - 3-4ns. Pulses are generated in burst mode. Pulse amplitude stability within a burst is better than 1%. PRF within a burst can vary. The other kicker HVG type provides square pulses with 10-100kV amplitude; 1-100ns pulse duration. PRF can be up to 1kHz; 0; 1-10ns rise time. HVG is connected to load via 75-50Ohm coaxial cables. Peak current is up to several kA; and generated pulses have high amplitude and time stability; time jitter does not exceed 30ps. This gives possibility of using multichannel HVGs in synchronous mode. HVGs for klystrons have 50-300kV amplitude; 100ns-several mks pulse duration. Minimum rise time is about 10-20ns; stability of pulse flat top is a few per cent.

For that purpose it is required that a proton beam; accelerated up to 250 MeV; penetrates on a depth about of 30 cm. It is known that linac; cyclotron and synchrotron can be used as a sources of proton/ion beams. The main linac advantages are a high beam quality and a possibility of beam energy variation but; on the other hand; initial low-energy part of a linac is markedly expensive. Production of mentioned beams is possible on the base of a concept called CYCLINAC; when a commercial cyclotron is used as an injector; in which protons are accelerated up to 20-30 MeV; for main linac. Matching the beam from a cyclotron with a linac input is the main problem of this concept. It is caused by difference of operating frequencies of cyclotron and linear accelerator as well as a high phase size of a bunch from the cyclotron. It is proposed to use the system of independently phased bunchers for beam matching. Solenoids are proposed to use for a limitation of transverse emittance growth. The BEAMDULAC-CYCLINAC program is developed for simulation of the self-consistent dynamics of proton beams in a matching channel. Results of beam dynamics simulation for CYCLINAC will be presented and discussed.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa011_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa011.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa011_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA011,234

Depending on generation wave range the threshold current strikes from fraction of ampere to dozens of amperes. In order to rich laser saturation; from hundreds to thousands electron bunches are required. Simple estimations give the value from units up to tens joules of bunches train energy in order to rich FEL saturation for infrared wave range (approximately 20 - 25 MeV of bunches energy and 3 A of pick current; bunch length being 1 cm). A beam with parameters mentioned might be obtained in rf superconducting linac operating in stored energy mode. The advantage of such approach is simplified linac power supply since dozens watts cw rf generator is required only to rich necessary accelerating voltage. At the same time the energy spread arising from beam loading may be compensated by additional cavities exited at shifted frequencies. In this paper Maxwell equations are used for beam-cavity interaction analysis. The bunch energy loss or the same the voltage induced by radiating bunch is expressed in terms of cavity external parameters. The detailed analysis of beam energy spread compensation is carried out followed by an example showing the reality of FEL schema suggested.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa012_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa012.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa012_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA012,237

Single particle dynamics was studied in order to trace the mechanism of halo formation and beam loss. We find that the lesser the degree of the space-charge non-linearity the better the beam performance; and from this point of view annular beams are best.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa021_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa021.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa021_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA021,
rupac2016,,TUPSA024,On Stabilization of Systems of Linear Equations with Linear Increasing Time Delay by Observation,O.N. Chizhova; A.P. Zhabko; Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg; Russia,,Differential-difference equations with time delay are often used in mathematical models describing the dynamics of beams of the charged particles. For example linear equation of the second order with a constant time delay describes in the smoothed approach dynamics of a beam of the charged particles in synchrotrons with a feedback system. However the time delay cannot always be considered constant. The time proportional delay can occur at acceleration of beams of the charged particles in the cyclotron. It should be noted that such time delay is unbounded and well known approaches are not applicable for stability analysis such systems. The stabilizing control for the system of linear equations could be constructed by the information on a state vector of the system. Sometimes the state vector is unknown but we know some linear combinations of its components. Then there is a problem on construction of the stabilizing control with incomplete information. In this paper we investigate a possibility of stabilization of system of linear equations with time proportional delay by the linear observation. Using the sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability of system of linear equations with linear increasing delay we obtain some conditions of existence of the asymptotic evaluation system of the original system. Then we use the asymptotic evaluation system for the construction of the stabilizing control and derive the sufficient conditions for the existence of such control. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa024_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa024.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa024_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA024,261

It is planed that all three modes as ee; hh and eh will be available for FCC. New injection system for FCC-ee is planned to consist of new ~ 2 GeV electron linac and electron-positron converter. Two possible layouts for further beam acceleration are discussed. The high-energy 14 GeV linac is the first layout and the booster synchrotron is the second one. Pre-injector linac design will have two regimes: ~250 pC bunches for injection and ~6 nC bunches for e−/e+ conversion. In the second case we will have extreme parameters: bunch charge up to 6 nC in 10 ps; up to 10 bunches per pulse and the pulse repetition rate up to 100 Hz. Such beam parameters lead to significant design difficulties caused by very high influence of Coulomb field in the near-cathode region and high peak beam loading.

Interference switch is based on series of H-plane T-junctions (cascade switch) in the view of decreasing switched power at Off state and comprises irises in both its own input and output arms. At On state the irises act as a transmission resonator localizing the nodes of the standing wave at the junctions. Such distribution is expected to decrease the plasma losses. It was shown with a simulation that the cascade switch with additional irises increases the efficiency of the active microwave compressors.

One of the main problem is the absence of the working FEL with required parameters. The feasibility study of those FEL based on superconducting energy-recovery linac (ERL) was made in Budker INP. The ERL average current is limited by longitudinal and transverse instabilities; caused by interaction between electron beam and its induced fields in the superconducting cavities.

rupac2016,,TUPSA051,Form-factor Determination of an Arbitrary Bunch Sequence for the Coherent Radiation Calculation,D.A. Shkitov; A.E. Harisovapresenter; TPU; Tomsk; Russia; It is well known that the coherent effect occur when charged particles in a bunch radiate in phase. This is accompanied by a quadratic increase in the radiation intensity and significantly influences the radiation spectrum. The coherent radiation is characterized by a form factor; which is the coefficient mainly depending on the ratio of bunch dimensions to the observed radiation wave length. The form factors will be different for the synchrotron and transition radiation because of their different nature of radiation. Now electron accelerators that produced beams with a sub-picosecond bunch length and a picosecond distance between them already exist. Through the appearance of interference between radiation from such a sequence of bunches; the total intensity is no longer equal to the sum of radiation from each bunches. For this reason; it is essential to determine the form factor of an arbitrary electron bunch sequence. Herein the uniform bunch distribution will be the special case. In this report we describe an approach to obtaining the form factor of the arbitrary bunch sequence.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa051_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa051.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa051_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA051,322
rupac2016,,TUPSA052,First Order Perturbation Theory Evaluation of Initial Stage of Self Amplified Crystal-Based X-Ray Emission,BSU; Minsk; Belarus; Belarus; X-ray Free Electron Lasers open new revolutionary opportunities for investigations in materials science; chemistry; biology and other areas. However; due to high cost of construction and maintain; the access to these facilities for wide scientific community is quite limited. This motivates search for schemes of compact bright x-ray sources. The size of X-ray Free Electron Lasers is dictated by basic properties of undulator radiation: to produce x-rays with Angstrom wavelength from cm period undulator one needs electrons with energy in GeV range. If one considers the radiation mechanisms accompanying the propagation of electron beam through a crystal structure (channeling radiation; parametric x-ray radiation; Cherenkov radiation near K-edge); one can see that to get photons in x-ray range one needs electrons with energy of tens to hundreds MeV. One of the ways to get bright x-ray source based on crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms is to run the electrons in coherent radiation regime based on self amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). In the present contribution we will discuss under which conditions the SASE can start in the case of crystal-assisted radiation mechanisms. To investigate the initial stage of SASE process we use the first-order perturbation theory that enables to describe the collective beam response as effective susceptibility. Based on this approach we will analyze which experimental geometry would promising for the SASE process onset.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/tupsa052_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/tupsa052.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/tupsa052_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-TUPSA052,325

Nowadays they are one of the main factors limiting the achievement of the required facility parameters. In many cases in the development of new accelerators the analytical estimations give very coarse results and in some cases they don't apply at all. Therefore; the best way to research and design accelerators is to use numerical simulation. Nevertheless; very often during complex physical process simulation (taking into account many nonlinear effects) the use of classical optimization methods is difficult and does not give the desired results. The article deals with the application of multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms for accelerators and light sources.

The focus of the study has been on the dependence of resonant frequency on the parameters of the geometry. Since Alternating-Phase-Focusing (APF) type of accelerator is investigated; the efficiency of the operation depends on the synchronization of the charged particle velocity and accelerating field oscillations. Researchers can control it by the variation of longitudinal size of the cells of the structure (periods). On the other hand; the effective performance of the resonant system requires the equality of resonant frequencies of its cells; because it affects the uniformity of accelerating field distribution along the axis. The diversity of cells longitudinal sizes causes the deviation from the particular value of the resonant frequency. This aberration can be eliminated by the adjustment of other geometry parameters: period's length; gap ratio and drift tube diameter. We have conducted the study to analyze the relation between resonant frequency and these values. Using the this dependency we can tune the geometry parameters of each period in the structure. We first create the computer-aided design (CAD) geometry model of the accelerator cavity. Then; using Comsol Multiphysics; the platform for physics-based modeling and simulation; we conduct the calculation of resonant frequencies.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/wepsb013_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/wepsb013.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/wepsb013_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-WEPSB013,386

On the other hand; when chromaticity is equal to zero the instability has a threshold and respectively called TMCI (transverse mode coupling instability). The question of convergence of TMCI threshold is still open. In this presentation we will consider various longitudinal distribution functions of a bunch (bi-Gaussian and Hoffman-Pedersen distributions; Boxcar model and bunch in a square potential well) under the action of driving and detuning wake forces. We will discuss the appearance of instability for different families of wake functions.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/wepsb022_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/wepsb022.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/wepsb022_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-WEPSB022,

It is shown in one-dimensional geometry that one physical mechanism that is responsible for the generation of electron bunches is self-injection of electrons into the wake field of a laser pulse; which occurs due to the mixing of electrons during the action of the laser pulse on plasma. The length of the trapped electron bunch is determined by the effect of kinematic grouping; which consists in the fact that electron self-injection into the wake wave occurs at the point of space and the moment of time when the previously trapped electrons are close to this point. Subsequently; during acceleration of trapped electrons in the wake wave; the length of the bunch increases as a result of the initial spread in the conditions of electron injection and their mutual repulsion in the bunch. Simple analytic relationships were obtained that can be used for estimating the length; charge of an electron bunch and the spread of electron energies**.; *S.V. Kuznetsov Tech. Phys.

Such resonator is a multidimensional space-periodic structure (natural or artificial electromagnetic (photonic) crystal). Previously VFEL were considered in various two- and three-wave diffraction geometries theoretically and experimentally. Here the general system of equations describing the various variants of multiple beam multi-wave VFEL is proposed. It takes into account multisection resonator; the dispersion of electromagnetic waves in the system; external reflectors etc. The mathematical modeling of two-beam two-wave VFEL was carried out using the proposed system of equations. It is shown that the change of current density of electron beams leads to change of VFEL chaotic dynamics and is one of the ways of chaos control in the system.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/wepsb029_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/wepsb029.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/wepsb029_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-WEPSB029,

Since the main source of synchrotron light are storage rings; the specifics of each machine in this case should be taken into account by its beta function. Vertical and radial small oscillations for the problem of radiation can be determined in the linear approximation but for the angular velocity necessary to maintain the guadratic terms. Following the Schwinger method we define the components of the linear polarization for the radiation intensity with the first quantum correction although in this case it is a small. After transfomations we obtain the genaral formulas for the spectral-angular distributions; depending on the axial velocity of the charged particle; moreover is considered the point in the orbit at which the radiation is removed.

We consider the structure of the electromagnetic field in the circular waveguide which consists of two semi-infinite parts. One of them is empty and the other one has a cylindrical dielectric layer and a coaxial vacuum channel. Incident electromagnetic field is a symmetrical TM mode launching either from the vacuum part or from the partially dielectric part. Such mode can be excited by a particle bunch moving along the waveguide axis. The analytical investigation of reflected and transmitted fields is performed. On the basis of this study; we develop an algorithm for numerical calculation and demonstrate properties of waveguide modes excited because of presence of transversal boundary.

In these cases the application of classic method of passive beam scattering with a one-stage formation of dose distribution may be reasonable. However; the last method in its standard implementation fails to provide the dose conformity: either the maximal dose exceeds the tumor volume on its proximate site or the dose deviates too much within the tumor. In order to overcome this shortcoming of the passive scattering method; we suggest a new construction of a two-component ridge filter (the corresponding patent is pending). We have performed a series of calculations with the Monte-Carlo code SRNA in order to find the optimal construction from the point of view of dose delivery accuracy and of the device manufacturability. With that ridge filter the 95% isodose does not notably leave the tumor volume. The usual 'wings' of isodoses on proximate side are now absent and the volume of irradiated healthy tissue is significantly reduced.

The dependence of the spent energy on the particle type; accelerator type and beam intensity was discussed. The energy released in targets with different levels of enrichment was calculated. The possibility to use a target with core from various materials and the influence on the energy released was also investigated. The optimal energy for protons is 3 GeV in a synchrotron; 1- 1.5 Gev in linac and 1 GeV in cyclotron.

Due to the relatively large distance between the injectors and plasma; the tokamak stray magnetic field inside injectors during the operation should be very low (down to the tenths of Gauss) to avoid the deflection of the ion beams. The Magnetic Field Reduction System (MFRS) should be used to reduce the stray magnetic field produced by the tokamak EM systems and plasma to an acceptable level inside the injectors. In total; the complex MFRS can consist of a passive magnetic shield and active coils to provide the strict design criteria during a plasma scenario. To provide precise computations; detailed numerical models of MFRS should have the dimensions up to several tens of millions of degrees of freedom. Such problem could be solved only with the use of high-efficiency vector algorithms and parallel computations.

For example; concrete structures of buildings are reinforced with steel rebar that can produce a local substantial contribution into the magnetic field in the area where the service staff and magnetically sensitive equipment is located. The article describes an advanced approach to modelling magnetic properties of reinforced concrete structures taking into account the anisotropic effect due to rod layers orientations. The equivalent model has been validated in the computation of a test problem. For comparison; simulations have been carried out with a detailed 3D FE model that describes each of the steel rods. The equivalent model has required a few times less finite elements than the detailed model.

The extraction systems meant for energy of the accelerated electrons up to 10 MeV and beam power up to 100 kW are described. The analysis of their work subject to the processes connected with the induced eddy currents in metal walls of beam scanning chambers is made; special attention is paid to forming of the dose field in a radiation zone. In paper the magnetic system for bending of the nonmonochromatic beams is offered to application. The essence of the described device consists in application of two identical magnetic mirrors in which distribution of magnetic field on depth is formed so that natural rise of magnetic field intensity on an entrance to a mirror is followed by decrease of this field under a certain law. In the issue of impact on charged particles of forces arising in cylindrical lenses of each mirror is possible to compensate angular divergence of strongly nonmonochromatic beams in gaps of magnetic mirrors and to receive after bending a beam with parameters close to phase characteristics of an input beam. The design procedure of such bending device and a general view of installation for experimental check of the offered bending system on electron beam are given in this paper. reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc008_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc008.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc008_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC008,556

Design and optimization of the systems led to the necessity of solving a nonlinear boundary-value problem of the magnetostatic. The considered region consists of two sub-domains namely: vacuum and ferromagnetic. In view of complexity of magnetic systems; the ferromagnetic/vacuum boundary can be non-smooth; i.e. it includes a corner point that separate two smooth curves belongs to different sub-domains and crossed in the corner point at some angle. A nonlinear differential equation of divergent type in the domain with a corner and the opportunity of existence of solutions with an unlimitedly growing module of gradient in the vicinity of the corner point have been considers in**. A theorem of limitation of the module of gradient of the solution in the vicinity of the corner point in the case of the magnetic permeability satisfying to certain conditions at high fields was proved. An upper estimate of the maximum possible growth of the magnetic field in the corner domain is presented in [4]. The method of designing the differential mesh near the corner domain allowed reducing considerably a relative error of calculating the magnetic field in the considered design problems. Examples of calculating some magnetic systems containing a domain with the corner point are given in [2-4].; * Perepelkin E. and ATLAS collaboration; Aad; JINST 2008; S08003; vol.3; p.437.  ** Perepelkin E.E. et al.

Frascati; Frascati (Roma); Italy; OCEM and ENEA gained a wide experience in the design and experimental characterization of fast and accurate switching systems for high DC currents; as required to supply magnets and superconductors. The exploited idea consists in inserting an electronic switch in parallel to a light electromechanical switch in air to combine the benefits of both devices. The electronic switch is turned on and off to support the electromechanical commutations limiting their jitter and the arcs that would reduce the system lifetime. During the already performed tests; DC currents up to 20 kA were diverted in less than 100 mks with good repeatability. In case of emergency; the current can be interrupted in few tens of milliseconds. A resistor can be inserted in parallel to the switch to discharge inductive loads or to produce desired overvoltages (a voltage up to 5 kV was reached in this configuration). Specific circuits were designed to preserve the components from transient voltage overshoots. This switching system is expected to work for 10000 operations without major maintenance. The developed solutions may be extended to many relevant applications as particle accelerators and HVDC networks.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc028_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc028.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc028_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC028,603

The proton beam is obtained by stripping negative hydrogen inside gas target. Using the gas target leads to interaction of injected beam with gas and producing unwanted flow of electrons in accelerating channel. Occurred electrons are accelerated up to 1 MeV energy; bombard the electrodes and produce radiation. For suppressing of electrons; electrodes diaphragm with magnets was designed. Diaphragm was set on first electrode; where electrons have low (166 keV) energy. The field about 15 mT separate main beam particles and electrons on 2 components. Thus; the main beam passes freely through diaphragm and accelerates; and electrons beam; with low energy; land on the first electrode. This article shows that the setting of diaphragm with magnets conduct to ~30% decreasing of radiation dose.

Combination of laser accelerated electrons and Compton backscattering of probe light beam opens possibility to create the table top source of femtosecond light beam in x-ray and gamma range. Project of laser-driven Compton light source started in ILP SB RAS in collaboration with BINP SB RAS. Production of 1-10 pC electron beams sub-ps time range duration with energies up to 100 MeV is expected as a result of the first stage of the project. Since energy of electrons does not exceed of 100 MeV; it allows using Faraday cup (FC) with reasonable dimensions; instead of commonly used integrating current transformer (ICT).

These experiments were carried out on bremsstrahlung beam of the linear accelerator 'Philips SL-75' with 6 MeV energy and 4 Gr/min dose rate at 1 m distance. In works ** and *** authors have showed feasibility of Cherenkov radiation applying for high energy beam diagnostics. In our work the Cherenkov radiation yield dependence on the fiber orientation relative to the beam axis was investigated and showed that the maximal light yield corresponds to the angle between fiber and beam axes closed to the Cherenkov angle. When dose rate is higher than 1 Gr/min at 1 m distance one can register a light yield for the fiber orientation even less than Cherenkov angle. We suppose that the observed effect is connected with generating of electromagnetic shower by initial photons. Proposed technique of bremsstrahlung and electron **** beams profile measurements differs from well-known techniques based on ionization chambers due to its insensitive to low energy part of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and to undesirable background. Using this technique for beam profile scanning it is possible to construct compact and noise insensitive device relative to the well-known systems.

rupac2016,,THPSC049,Dielectric Chart as a Tool for Diagnosis of Dielectric Materials,V.A. Klemeshev; A.G. Karpov; St. Petersburg State University; St. Petersburg; Russia; One of the most informative diagnostic methods dielectric materials is the analysis of the complex permittivity depending on the frequency of the electric field*. Dielectric chart is the dependence of the imaginary part of the complex permittivity of its real part. Thus; difference between the real dielectric chart from the reference or change it during the operation can be a means of diagnostics of dielectric materials. Dielectric chart in the classical theory of Debye is a semicircle with its center lying on the real axis. For solid dielectric the dielectric chart deviation from the semicircle can be quite large; but it still remains a circular arc. This deviation is characterized by parameter a (in the case of the Debye a=0). To clarify the physical meaning of the deviations of the experimental data on the Debye theory; expressed in the value of a; several possible causes have been considered: the effect hindered reorientation of dipoles; the effect of the non-sphericity of the molecules; the complex nature of viscosity. However; the main cause of deviations; in our opinion; is the availability of the distribution of relaxation times around a central relaxation time; in particular; due to defects in the sample. Gaussian distribution width increases rapidly with increasing a. In this paper we propose an algorithm for calculating a; allowing you to quickly determine the condition of the sample on a single parameter.; * Karpov A.G.; Egorov N.V.

rupac2016,,THPSC050,Possibilities of Diffraction Radiation Non-Destructive Diagnostics for Non- and Moderately Relativistic Beams,D.A. Shkitov; A. Potylitsyn; TPU; Tomsk; Russia; In order to design and construct new modern accelerators with high brightness beams; the development new non-destructive diagnostic tools for accelerated beams is required. Diffraction radiation (DR) is generated by charged particles moving in the vicinity of the conductive target. The DR technique is used successfully for non-destructive diagnostics for ultrarelativistic beams*; **. For non-relativistic and moderately relativistic charged particles beams (g ~ a few tens or less; g is the Lorentz factor) non-destructive DR diagnostics can be applied also if a beam intensity is high enough due to coherent effect. Intensity of coherent radiation is proportional to the squared bunch population. In this report estimations of non-destructive bunch diagnostics possibility based on DR for the beam parameters of a few machines are presented. Those estimations were performed for electron machine: PITZ project*** and laser wakefield accelerator****; and moreover for ESS proton linear accelerator*****. First evaluation of whole wavelength range DR from 4-mm-slit target gave about 56 mJ from one macro-pulse of ESS accelerator. Amplification of DR spectral-angular intensity due to coherent effect will be in N = 108 times than incoherent radiation from the same beam; where N is the bunch population.; * P.

In order to measure the longitudinal bunch size at different currents we used PS-1/S1 streak camera with picosecond temporal resolution. Considering that influence of collective effects is negligible at low currents we determined bunch energy spread from its length at low currents. Collected bunch length data demonstrate microwave instability thresholds and potential well distortion lengthening. Potential well distortion was studied at 3 GeV and 3.5 GeV. Measured potential well distortion lengthening was used to estimate a value of the reactive part of the longitudinal impedance. Observed microwave instability thresholds was used to measure the value of broadband impedance.

To ensure its stable operation and radiation generation; it is necessary to provide a stable mode of electron beam recirculation and minimize beam losses on the vacuum chamber wall on all the way of beam in the accelerator beamline. To fulfil this task it is necessary to know the longitudinal distribution of these losses along the beamline. To this end; a system for registration of beam losses was created. The system applies optical fibers placed along the full length of the vacuum chamber and nearby it. In case of local electron beam losses somewhere in the vacuum chamber; electrons falling to the vacuum chamber wall cause generation of X- and gamma rays. This radiation in turn causes generation of optical radiation in the optic fiber nearby the region of electron 'precipitation' on the chamber wall. Then; executing some transformation and processing of the time dependencies of signals from these optic fibers; one can obtain the longitudinal distribution of electron beam losses along the whole accelerator channel in all its 4 turns.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS,,reference for this paper using,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc062_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc062.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc062_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC062,

The coaxial cavity has the function of pre-buncher to control the injection phase and power of electron bunches into the main accelerating body*. Transient tests have demonstrated the quarter wavelength cavity to be undercoupled. However; for operation at high beam loading conditions overcoupled conditions are required. In order to control the coupling we have developed an external air side coaxial quarter wavelength impedance converter.

For several reasons the real beam flow in the facility differs from the calculated one. To take into account this distinction it is necessary to provide continuous monitoring of the beam parameters. In order to optimize the facility operation the beam should be followed not only during the formation but also while an acceleration takes place and the proton beam is thrown on the lithium target as the proton current and energy influence on the neutron output. In this way it seems to be a significant issue to measure the current; profile and also the position of the ion beam in a low-energy part of the accelerator. This work represents the results of experiments with the D-Pace WS-30 Wire Scanner Probe; which was installed in the low-energy part of the accelerator. The experiments were carried out under various conditions to vary the position and focusing control via the system of magnetic correcting elements. To correctly interpret experimental data it was necessary to take into account physical phenomena which occur during an experiment. In this way the effects which take place when the probe interacts with the beam were thoroughly considered. The obtained results allowed to restore the ion beam profile; define its size and position.,Funding: The study was supported by grants from the Russian Science Foundation (Project no. 14-32-00006) and the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics and the Novosibirsk State University.,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc069_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc069.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc069_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC069,695

Neutrons on the facility are generated during the threshold reaction 7Li(p; n)7Be which occurs when the proton beam is thrown on the lithium target. To control the neutron output it is necessary to monitor the parameters of the accelerated proton beam. The spatial distribution of the accelerated proton beam was measured exactly on the lithium target. Due to the interaction of protons and lithium there is an accumulation of a radioactive isotope of beryllium takes place. After experiments about neutrons generation it seems possible to track an area of beryllium storage and then restore the proton beam profile. The monitoring of gamma-quants with the energy of 0; 477 MeV arising during the beryllium decay was carried out via the gamma-spectrometric complex. The main part of this complex is NaI-scintillation detector; which was pre-calibrated with energy. As a result of such kind of diagnostic the profile of the beam; its shape and characteristic size were determined and the results are depicted in this paper. Afterwards it could be used for an estimation of the total neutrons flux; its quantity; also to assess the target state and restore the proton beam profile.,Funding: The study was supported by grants from the Russian Science Foundation (Project no. 14-32-00006) and the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics and the Novosibirsk State University.,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc070_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc070.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc070_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC070,698

In this paper we propose a method that allows carrying out express analysis of the charged particles flux density distribution based on mathematical reconstruction technology using the inverse Radon transformation. The research shows the theoretical justification of this method and determination of the necessary projection number. The experimental set up for the cross-section flux density distribution of the charged particles based on mathematical reconstruction technology is presented. The approbation results of this set up on the microtron TPU extracted electron beam are shown.

They provide good stability at sufficient speed-work. 2.Increased requirements of technological lines to the speed of the accelerator injection to set-up parameters and introduction of technological lines; in which the accelerator is a slave device and should within the shortest possible time to respond onto the changes of operation input parameters; forced us to find the way of stabilization systems improvement. 3.New stabilization system is able to provide current output speed up to 5mA/sec; at required energy stability. 4.Digital-to-analog stabilization is produced as a superstructure on the existing system and is made as a source code added into the basic accelerator control program. This approach enables to modernize simply the existing accelerators. The code itself is two independent parts. The first part is the current beam corrector; which calculate the derivate (current speed) at a time and aims to hold it in set-up range; taking into account the difference of the tasks and the necessity of cathode warm up.

They are also used for the analysis and synthesis of magnetic control devices. An actual problem for such systems is stabilization of their operating modes. In this report; analytical and numerical investigations of stability of the equilibrium position for a nonlinear oscillatory system are presented. The system can be treated as a mathematical model of magnetic suspension control system of a gyro rotor. A delay in the feedback control scheme and dissipative forces occurring due to energy losses at the interaction of the magnetic field with currents in the control loops are taken into account. Two approaches to the synthesis of stabilizing controls are proposed. The first one is based on the using of gyroscopic control forces. It is applicable in the case of essentially nonlinear homogeneous dissipative forces. The second approach is efficient for systems with linear dissipative forces. For this case; potential control forces are constructed. With the aid of a computer simulation of dynamics of closed-loop systems; a comparison of these approaches is fulfilled; and their features and conditions of applicability are determined.,"Funding: The research was partially supported by the Saint Petersburg State University (project No. 9.37.157.2014), and by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (grant Nos. 15-08-06680 and 16-01-00587-a).",reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc087_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc087.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc087_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC087,736

rupac2016,,THPSC090,The Stochastic Characteristics Stability in the Problem of Observation and Estimate of the Charged Particles Movement,Saint Petersburg State University; Saint Petersburg; Russia; The charged beam moving in the accelerator is modelled by particle-in-cell method. The control with delay in the connection canal is simulated by the after-effect. Thus; the model is described by system of the differential equations with delay. We observe and estimate changes of particles coordinates in the cross-section of the accelerator. It is supposed that initial conditions are the set with random error and we have chance of updating the solution in periodic timepoints with the same error. The dependence between the estimate dispersion and the measuring error dispersion is recieved.,,reference for this paper ※ DOI:10.18429/JACoW-RuPAC2016-,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/talks/thpsc090_talk.pdf,False,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/papers/thpsc090.pdf,True,https://proceedings.jacow.org/rupac2016/posters/thpsc090_poster.pdf,False,https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-RUPAC2016-THPSC090,742
