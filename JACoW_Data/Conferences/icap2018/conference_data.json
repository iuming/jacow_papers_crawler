The Core Oscillation Method (COM) and Bunch-Align-Compress (BAC) method have recently emerged as a means to greatly increase the efficiency of the klystron RF source for particle accelerators. The COM and BAC methods both work by uniquely tuning klystron cavity frequencies such that more particles from the anti-bunch are swept into the bunch before power is extracted from the beam. The single objective genetic algorithm from Sandia National Laboratory’s Dakota optimization library is used to optimize both COM and BAC based klystron designs to achieve 85% efficiency. The COM and BAC methods are discussed. Use of the Dakota optimization algorithm library from Sandia National Laboratory is discussed. Scalability of the optimization approach to High Performance Computing (HPC) is discussed. The optimization approach and optimization results are presented."

            "I will focus on the correction of spherical and chromatic aberrations of a cathode lens instrument (i.e. Low Energy Electron Microscope ’LEEM- or Photo Electron Emission Microscope ’ PEEM) using catadioptrics",
            "i.e. a combination of electron lenses (dioptrics) and an electron mirror (catoptrics). First-order properties calculated with high precision using Munro’s Electron Beam Software’s MIRDA package are in excellent with detailed experimental results. Theoretical maps of C3 vs Cc as a function of the applied potentials then provide a deterministic method to dial in the desired mirror properties at will. Now it is necessary to measure the resultant aberrations of the full system. Unfortunately",
            "the experimental methods developed for TEM and STEM are not applicable in LEEM/PEEM for a variety of reasons. Spherical aberration (plus defocus and astigmatism) can be measured using so-called micro-spot real-space Low Energy Electron Diffraction",
            "or by measuring image shift as a function of beam tilt. Measuring chromatic aberration is more troublesome as it conventionally requires that defocus be measured as a function of gun voltage. However",
            "the use of magnetic prism arrays to separate in- and outgoing path in LEEM results in changing alignment conditions when gun voltage is changed. However",
            "a novel method first demonstrated using ray-tracing simulations enables us to measure chromatic aberration",
            "even at fixed gun voltage. The chromatically corrected system behaves like a simple (but adjustable) achromat",
            "comparable to the crown/flint optical achromat invented by Chester Moore Hall around 1730."

Among the most successful numerical techniques for wake field calculations in the time domain are dispersion-free methods in the moving window. These techniques are particularly useful for short-range wake field calculations. Recently",
            "this class of methods has been extended to include Surface Impedance Boundary Conditions (SIBC) based on the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique. These boundary conditions allow the computation of resistive wall wake fields for 3D structures with arbitrary frequency dependent conductivity. An important application of this method is the calculation resistive wall wake fields in novel accelerator chambers with NEG and amorphous carbon coatings. Other developments to be discussed include the calculation of CSR-wakes in bunch compressors and undulator structures for x-ray sources. This task is computationally very difficult because of the curved bunch trajectory that leads to extremely high frequency and long-range wake fields. Time domain as well as frequency domain methods based on high order DG and FE discretization techniques for the electromagnetic fields computation in such structures will be presented."

Our work is based on the initial value problem of what we call the full Bloch equations (FBEs). The solution of the FBEs is the polarization density which is proportional to the spin angular momentum density per particle in phase space and which determines the polarization vector of the bunch. The FBEs take into account spin diffusion effects and spin-flip effects due to synchrotron radiation including the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov generalization. The FBEs were introduced by Derbenev and Kondratenko in 1975 as a generalization of the Baier-Katkov-Strakhovenko equations from a single orbit to the whole phase space. The FBEs are a system of three uncoupled Fokker-Planck equations plus two coupling terms",
            "i.e.",
            "the T-BMT term and the Baier-Katkov term. Neglecting the spin flip terms in the FBEs one gets what we call the reduced Bloch equations (RBEs). The RBEs are sufficient for computing the depolarization time. The conventional approach of estimating and optimizing the polarization is not based on the FBEs but on the so-called Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas. However",
            "we believe that the FBEs offer a more complete starting point for very high energy rings like the FCC-ee and CEPC. The issues for very high energy are: (i) Can one get polarization",

            "what are the theoretical limits of the polarization? Item (ii) will be addressed both numerically and analytically. Our numerical approach has three parts. Firstly we approximate the FBEs analytically using the method of averaging",
            "resulting in FBEs which allow us to use large time steps (without the averaging the time dependent coefficients of the FBEs would necessitate small time steps). The minimum length of the time interval of interest is of the order of the orbital damping time. Seco"

            "In this talk we present some numerical results from our work on the spin polarization in high energy electron storage rings. The motivation of our work is to understand spin polarization in very high energy rings like the proposed Future Circular Collider* (FCC-ee) and Circular Electron Positron Collider** (CEPC). This talk is a supplement to K. Heinemann’s talk and gives further numerical details and results. As discussed in Heinemann’s talk our work is based on the initial value problem of the full Bloch equations*** (FBEs) which in turn determines the polarization vector of the bunch. The FBEs take into account spin diffusion effects and spin-flip effects due to synchrotron radiation. The FBEs are a system of three uncoupled Fokker-Planck equations plus coupling terms. Neglecting the spin flip terms in the FBEs one gets the reduced Bloch equations (RBEs) which poses the main computational challenge. Our numerical approach has three parts. Firstly we approximate the FBEs analytically using the method of averaging",
            "resulting in FBEs which allow us to use large time steps (without the averaging the time dependent coefficients of the FBEs would necessitate small time steps). The minimum length of the time interval of interest is of the order of the orbital damping time. Secondly we discretize the averaged FBEs in the phase space variables by applying the pseudospectral method",

The pseudospectral method is applied by using a Chebychev grid for each radial variable and a uniform Fourier grid for each angle variable. Thirdly we discretize the ODE system by a time stepping scheme. The presence of parabolic terms in the FBEs necessitates implicit time stepping and thus solutions of linear systems of equations.

Our recent work (Zerbe 2018) generalized Reed’s analysis to cylindrical and spherical geometries demonstrating the presence of a shock that is seen in the Coulomb explosion literature under these geometries and further discussed the absence of a shock in the 1D model. This work is relevant as it offers a mechanistic explanation of the ring-like density shock that arises in non-equilibrium pancake-beams within the photoelectron gun; moreover",

The eigenvalue nonlinearity in these problems results from the use of waveguides to couple external power sources or to allow certain excited electromagnetic modes to exit the cavity. We use a rational approximation to reduce the nonlinear eigenvalue problem first to a rational eigenvalue problem. We then apply a special linearization procedure to turn the rational eigenvalue problem into a larger linear eigenvalue problem with the same eigenvalues",

We refer to this method as a compact rational Krylov (CORK) method. We implemented the CORK method in the Omega3P module of the Advanced Computational Electromagnetic 3D Parallel (ACE3P) simulation suite and validated it by comparing the computed cavity resonant frequencies and damping Q factors of a small model problem to those obtained from a fitting procedure that uses frequency responses computed by another ACE3P module called S3P. We also used the CORK method to compute trapped modes damped in an ideal eight 9-cell SRF cavity cryomodule. This was the first time it was possible to compute these modes directly. The damping Q factors of the computed modes match well with those measured in experiments and the difference in resonant frequencies is within the range introduced by cavity imperfection. Therefore",

The deflector cavity induces energy distortions on the off-axis particles and corrupt real picture of the beam energy profile at spectrometer screen. A special computational phase space restoration technique which is under development at BNL ATF to reveal undistorted e-beam parameters will be discussed."

The BTF can produce pulsed high intensity H− beam with up to 50mA peak current. The expected available beam-on time of a few thousand hours per year provides an opportunity for carrying out advanced high intensity beam dynamics experiments. The first ever direct measurement of 6D phase space distribution of a beam in an accelerator has recently been completed. Preliminary analysis of the data shows a complex phase space structure that is not visible in measurements below 5D",

This result opens path forward to solving the long-standing problem of initial condition in hadron linac beam dynamics simulation. An extension of the BTF beam line consisting of a FODO line and high dynamic range emittance monitor is being built to provide a test bench for simulation codes benchmarking against measurements in well controlled environment. This paper describes these efforts along with the longer-term plans."

            "we have used TRACK and IMPACT simulation codes to study dynamics of ion beam contaminants extracted from the ECR together with main ion beam. The contaminant ion species can produce significant losses after the stripping. These studies resulted in development of beam collimation system at relatively low energy of 16 MeV/u and room temperature bunchers instead of originally planned SC cavities. Commissioning of the Front End and the first 3 cryomodules enabled detailed beam dynamics studies experimentally which were accompanied with the simulations using above-mentioned beam dynamics codes and optimization code FLAME. There are significant challenges in understanding of beam dynamics in the FRIB linac. The most computational challenges are in the following areas: (1) Simulation of the ion beam formation and extraction from the ECR; (2) Development of the virtual accelerator model available on-line both for optimization and multi-particle simulations. The virtual model should include realistic accelerator parameters including device misalignments; (3) Large scale simulations to support high-power ramp up of the linac with minimized beam losses; (4) Interaction of the beam with the gas stripper which is the backup option for high power operation of the linac."

The Core Oscillation Method (COM) and Bunch-Align-Compress (BAC) method have recently emerged as a means to greatly increase the efficiency of the klystron RF source for particle accelerators. The COM and BAC methods both work by uniquely tuning klystron cavity frequencies such that more particles from the anti-bunch are swept into the bunch before power is extracted from the beam. The single objective genetic algorithm from Sandia National Laboratory’s Dakota optimization library is used to optimize both COM and BAC based klystron designs to achieve 85% efficiency. The COM and BAC methods are discussed. Use of the Dakota optimization algorithm library from Sandia National Laboratory is discussed. Scalability of the optimization approach to High Performance Computing (HPC) is discussed. The optimization approach and optimization results are presented."

        "The precise modeling of proton therapy systems is challenging and requires simulation tools that have capabilities in both beam transport and in the detailed description of particle-matter interactions. Current separate simulations such as those of optical codes or Monte-Carlo transport through discrete elements show their limitations due to the very strict requirements on beam quality at the isocenter. This is particularly relevant with the development of compact systems where the coupling between the components is dominant. For such systems the design of the concrete shielding",
        "which has a large impact on the total cost of the system",
        "is of primary importance. Beam Delivery Simulation (BDSIM) allows the seamless simulation of the transport of particles in a beamline and its surrounding environment. A complete 3D model is built using Geant4",

Now it is necessary to measure the resultant aberrations of the full system. Unfortunately",

        "one has to rely on numerical electromagnetic field computation. Among the most successful numerical techniques for wake field calculations in the time domain are dispersion-free methods in the moving window. These techniques are particularly useful for short-range wake field calculations. Recently",
        "this class of methods has been extended to include Surface Impedance Boundary Conditions (SIBC) based on the Auxiliary Differential Equation (ADE) technique. These boundary conditions allow the computation of resistive wall wake fields for 3D structures with arbitrary frequency dependent conductivity. An important application of this method is the calculation resistive wall wake fields in novel accelerator chambers with NEG and amorphous carbon coatings. Other developments to be discussed include the calculation of CSR-wakes in bunch compressors and undulator structures for x-ray sources. This task is computationally very difficult because of the curved bunch trajectory that leads to extremely high frequency and long-range wake fields. Time domain as well as frequency domain methods based on high order DG and FE discretization techniques for the electromagnetic fields computation in such structures will be presented."

Our work is based on the initial value problem of what we call the full Bloch equations (FBEs). The solution of the FBEs is the polarization density which is proportional to the spin angular momentum density per particle in phase space and which determines the polarization vector of the bunch. The FBEs take into account spin diffusion effects and spin-flip effects due to synchrotron radiation including the Sokolov-Ternov effect and its Baier-Katkov generalization. The FBEs were introduced by Derbenev and Kondratenko in 1975 as a generalization of the Baier-Katkov-Strakhovenko equations from a single orbit to the whole phase space. The FBEs are a system of three uncoupled Fokker-Planck equations plus two coupling terms",
        "i.e.",
        "the T-BMT term and the Baier-Katkov term. Neglecting the spin flip terms in the FBEs one gets what we call the reduced Bloch equations (RBEs). The RBEs are sufficient for computing the depolarization time. The conventional approach of estimating and optimizing the polarization is not based on the FBEs but on the so-called Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas. However",
        "we believe that the FBEs offer a more complete starting point for very high energy rings like the FCC-ee and CEPC. The issues for very high energy are: (i) Can one get polarization",
        "(ii) are the Derbenev-Kondratenko formulas satisfactory at very high energy? If not",
        "what are the theoretical limits of the polarization? Item (ii) will be addressed both numerically and analytically. Our numerical approach has three parts. Firstly we approximate the FBEs analytically using the method of averaging",
        "resulting in FBEs which allow us to use large time steps (without the averaging the time dependent coefficients of the FBEs would necessitate small time steps). The minimum length of the time interval of interest is of the order of the orbital damping time. Seco"

The close interplay of the understanding of particle beam dynamics and the preparation of the beam properties for the experimental measurement is tantamount to the reduction of systematic errors in the determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon to unprecedented precision. The precision of the g-2 measurement will be increased by a factor of four over the most recent case (BNL",

        "it is possible that even further gains can be made through a better understanding of the muon beam being delivered to the g-2 Storage Ring. Several effects come into play that can contribute to systematic errors and for which detailed calculations and modeling of the incoming muon beam properties will aid in interpreting the results.  Various correlations of spin and momentum",

The motivation of our work is to understand spin polarization in very high energy rings like the proposed Future Circular Collider* (FCC-ee) and Circular Electron Positron Collider** (CEPC). This talk is a supplement to K. Heinemann’s talk and gives further numerical details and results. As discussed in Heinemann’s talk our work is based on the initial value problem of the full Bloch equations*** (FBEs) which in turn determines the polarization vector of the bunch. The FBEs take into account spin diffusion effects and spin-flip effects due to synchrotron radiation. The FBEs are a system of three uncoupled Fokker-Planck equations plus coupling terms. Neglecting the spin flip terms in the FBEs one gets the reduced Bloch equations (RBEs) which poses the main computational challenge. Our numerical approach has three parts. Firstly we approximate the FBEs analytically using the method of averaging",
        "resulting in FBEs which allow us to use large time steps (without the averaging the time dependent coefficients of the FBEs would necessitate small time steps). The minimum length of the time interval of interest is of the order of the orbital damping time. Secondly we discretize the averaged FBEs in the phase space variables by applying the pseudospectral method",

The pseudospectral method is applied by using a Chebychev grid for each radial variable and a uniform Fourier grid for each angle variable. Thirdly we discretize the ODE system by a time stepping scheme. The presence of parabolic terms in the FBEs necessitates implicit time stepping and thus solutions of linear systems of equations.

        "the XAL Online Model",
        "and TraceWin code are presented."

This model is relevant to ultra-fast electron microscopy as it describes the evolution of the distribution within the photoelectron gun",

Our recent work (Zerbe 2018) generalized Reed’s analysis to cylindrical and spherical geometries demonstrating the presence of a shock that is seen in the Coulomb explosion literature under these geometries and further discussed the absence of a shock in the 1D model. This work is relevant as it offers a mechanistic explanation of the ring-like density shock that arises in non-equilibrium pancake-beams within the photoelectron gun; moreover",

        "A proper eigenanalysis of resonating particle accelerator components is particularly advantageous to characterize structures with high quality factors. While in former times eigenmode calculations have been concentrating on the lossless cases only",
        "meanwhile also lossy structures with finite-conductive materials or with absorbing boundary conditions like PML or ports even with low quality factors are routinely available. In the lossless case where no damping is present",
        "all eigenvalues are located along the real axis. If damping has to be modeled instead",
        "the corresponding eigenvalues are distributed within the first quadrant of the complex plane that renders their determination much more expensive. One of the critical issues is that no resonance should be missed so that all desired eigenvalues in a given region of the complex plane can be precisely determined. We implemented two different eigenvalue solvers based on a distributed-memory architecture. While the first one is a classical Jacobi-Davidson eigenvalue solver which has been adopted to be used also within a complex-arithmetic environment",
        "the second one is based on the contour-integral method which enables to determine all eigenvalues within a given closed contour in the complex plane. Both solvers are attached to a FEM processor with second-order edge elements on curved tetrahedra and can be used together in order to improve the computational efficiency. In the presentation a selection of successful real-world applications of the implemented parallel eigenvalue solvers will be given."

        "We present an efficient and reliable algorithm for solving a class of nonlinear eigenvalue problems arising from the modeling of particle accelerator cavities. The eigenvalue nonlinearity in these problems results from the use of waveguides to couple external power sources or to allow certain excited electromagnetic modes to exit the cavity. We use a rational approximation to reduce the nonlinear eigenvalue problem first to a rational eigenvalue problem. We then apply a special linearization procedure to turn the rational eigenvalue problem into a larger linear eigenvalue problem with the same eigenvalues",
        "which can be solved by existing iterative methods. By using a compact scheme to represent both the linearized operator and the eigenvectors to be computed",
        "we obtain a numerical method that only involves solving linear systems of equations of the same dimension as the original nonlinear eigenvalue problem. We refer to this method as a compact rational Krylov (CORK) method. We implemented the CORK method in the Omega3P module of the Advanced Computational Electromagnetic 3D Parallel (ACE3P) simulation suite and validated it by comparing the computed cavity resonant frequencies and damping Q factors of a small model problem to those obtained from a fitting procedure that uses frequency responses computed by another ACE3P module called S3P. We also used the CORK method to compute trapped modes damped in an ideal eight 9-cell SRF cavity cryomodule. This was the first time it was possible to compute these modes directly. The damping Q factors of the computed modes match well with those measured in experiments and the difference in resonant frequencies is within the range introduced by cavity imperfection. Therefore",
        "the CORK method is an extremely valuable tool for computational cavity design."

        "we have used TRACK and IMPACT simulation codes to study dynamics of ion beam contaminants extracted from the ECR together with main ion beam. The contaminant ion species can produce significant losses after the stripping. These studies resulted in development of beam collimation system at relatively low energy of 16 MeV/u and room temperature bunchers instead of originally planned SC cavities. Commissioning of the Front End and the first 3 cryomodules enabled detailed beam dynamics studies experimentally which were accompanied with the simulations using above-mentioned beam dynamics codes and optimization code FLAME. There are significant challenges in understanding of beam dynamics in the FRIB linac. The most computational challenges are in the following areas: (1) Simulation of the ion beam formation and extraction from the ECR; (2) Development of the virtual accelerator model available on-line both for optimization and multi-particle simulations. The virtual model should include realistic accelerator parameters including device misalignments; (3) Large scale simulations to support high-power ramp up of the linac with minimized beam losses; (4) Interaction of the beam with the gas stripper which is the backup option for high power operation of the linac."

        "such as the photoinjector of the accelerator",
        "space charge interaction forces are the dominating effect influencing the dynamics of the electron beam. A direct computation of space charge forces is numerically very expensive. Commonly used simulation codes typically apply mesh based particle-in-cell methods (PIC) to solve this problem. Our simulation tool",
        "REPTIL",
        "is a relativistic",
        "three-dimensional space charge tracking code",
        "which computes the interaction forces based on a meshless fast multipole method (FMM). The FMM based space charge solver is more flexible regarding the choice of the interaction model and yields maximum accuracy for the near field forces between particles. For this reason",
        "the FMM is very suitable for the simulation of the influence of space charge on the particle emission process in high current photoinjectors. In this contribution",
        "we present a numerical study of the efficiency and the accuracy of the method. Therefore",
        "we perform a case study for the PITZ photoinjector used for the European XFEL at DESY. Furthermore",
        "we compare the performance of REPTIL with commonly used PIC codes like e.g. ASTRA. Finally",
        "we investigate a hybrid approach by using the FMM on a mesh. The latter method makes further increases in the particle number possible",
        "which translates to a higher resolution in the phase space of the electron bunch."
