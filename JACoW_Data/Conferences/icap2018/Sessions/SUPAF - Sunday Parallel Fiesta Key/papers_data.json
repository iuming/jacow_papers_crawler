        "One challenge of proton beam therapy is the shear size of its equipment. A proton gantry that rotates a beamline about a patient is typically about 10 meters in diameter",
        "heavy and expensive. One approach to reduce size and cost of gantries is their miniaturization by the application of superconducting (SC) magnets in the beamline. SC magnets",
        "however",
        "have difficulties to quickly adapt their field when the beam energy is changed. Achromatic beamline designs with high momentum acceptance based on superconducting magnets can lead to compact gantries that still allow rapid beam application which is an important clinical requirement. In a collaborative effort LBNL",
        "Varian Medical Systems and PSI have developed the Alternating Gradient Canted-Cosine-Theta (AG-CCT)",
        "a curved version of the CCT design that includes alternating quadrupole and sextupole components to build an achromat. The AG-CCT reaches a momentum acceptance of approx. 20 % dp/p while preserving beam profiles within clinical specification. Another design",
        "conceived by LBNL and Varian",
        "achieves momentum acceptance over the entire clinical beam energy range (70-225 MeV)",
        "called the fixed-field achromat. The beam optics principles of the two achromats and an optimized associated gantry beamline design is the main focus of the presented work",
        "as well as putting these in context of clinical requirements and economic constraints."

Global optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm or basin hopping schemes require numerous evaluations of the model and their practical implementations are limited by the computation time at each iteration. To overcome this limitation",

In order to capture the effects of halo creation and evolution of such simulations with standard particle-in-cell models an extremely fine mesh with O(108…109) grid points is necessary to meet the condition of high resolution. This requirement represents a waste of memory in regions of void",
        "therefore",
        "the usage of block-structured adaptive mesh refinement algorithms is more suitable. The N-body problem is then solved on a hierarchy of levels and grids using geometric multigrid algorithms. We show benchmarks of a new implementation of an adaptive geometric multigrid algorithm using 2nd generation Trilinos packages that ran on Piz Daint with O(104…105) cores."
