        "these magnets have to have a large angular acceptance for the divergent laser and electron beams which imposes constraint of the gap size. We will present the optimized design and charac- terization of a 100 mm long",
        "2.1 Tesla permanent magnet dipole. Furthermore",
        "we will present the performance of such a magnet as a spectrometer in the CILEX/APOLLON 10PW laser facility in France."

Space charge neutralization is provided by impact ionization of a background hydrogen gas. For optimal cooling it is essential that space charge be sufficiently neutralized.

        "2018. The paper describes the online tuning procedures of the longitudinal beam dynamics through the FRIB linac. These procedures include tuning of the accelerating field phases and amplitudes in the cavities. We developed an automated simulation-based tuning procedure for the multi-harmonic buncher. In order to tune the radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) we measured and calculated its threshold voltage and scanned its longitudinal acceptance. Tuning of the rebunchers and superconducting accelerating cavities is per-formed by means of the phase scans and Time-Of-Flight (TOF) beam energy measurements with beam position and phase monitors. While FRIB is being commissioned",
        "the re-accelerator (ReA3) for rare isotope beams (RIBs) is being upgraded. We redesigned the ReA3 RFQ to improve its cooling system and provide reliable operation with 16.1 MHz prebunched ion beams with A/Q = 5. In order to provide matching of any ReA3 beam both to the following upgrade cryomodules and physics experiments’ requirements",
